Stupidity as a Zero-Day Vulnerability in

Cybernetic Planetary Warfare

  
  

My work is an explicit search for logical exploits that authorize currently illegitimate action and thought. I am not interested in contributing knowledge within the boundaries of established discourses. I am much more interested in improvising tools and methods that operate in the blindspots of discursive regimes and practices. In hacker parlance, these blind-spots are called zero day vulnerabilities[1](#sdfootnote1sym). The term refers to time-sensitive vulnerabilities within code that allow for an utterly disproportionate capacity for manipulation and reconstruction. However, these exploits are fragile -- they expire as soon as the legitimate owners of code perceive this previously invisible phenomena and patch their code.

Operating under the understanding that discourse is always an unequal game played between unequal positions, my work is an appropriation and improvisation of any and all cognitive tools necessary to tap into the fundamental discontinuities present in discourses built on deductive logic. Manipulation of the fundamental philosophical distinction that delineates the border of a discipline allows for complete mobility of thought when found and exploited. In art, manipulating the fundamental distinction between art and life generates novel, alien forms of art. In architecture, manipulating the program, or an inhabitant’s stated intentions for a space, while simultaneously manipulating the standard spatial tools of architecture legitimately licenses illegitimate conceptions of architecture.

This is an incredibly common strategy in the think-tank ecosystem. Competitive think-tanks arbitrage multiple blind spots in multiple discourses to gain full mobility in all discourses. These epistemic advantages are critical in this environment where knowledge products are explicitly used as weaponry to legitimize desired courses of action.

This search for fundamental exploits has led me to invoke components of Deleuzian thought. In particular, I’m experimenting with what Brian Massumi refers to as ‘affect’ . ‘Affect’ is often confused with emotion -- but it is utterly different from emotion[2](#sdfootnote2sym). Affect, considered here as the capacity to affect and be affected, is located in the split-second interval prior to the moment that a subject constructs themselves into a cohesive entity that can recognize a stimuli[3](#sdfootnote3sym). One can imagine this interval by extending the trillionth of a second in which a nerve’s synapse is in mid-signal. In this interval, prior to its collapse into a state, the signal could be carrying any piece of information. That signal in that interval of time is the informational equivalent of a stem-cell. That informational stem-cell lives in the inexhaustible ground of possibilities that pre-exists what is usually identified as legitimate, recognizable entities in existing disciplines of knowledge.

Deleuze and Guattari wrote several texts that attempted to tie the technologies of writing and philosophy itself to manipulating and performing affect. One of the most prominent of these experiments is titled A Thousand Plateaus. This text is written for a specific mode of perception-- a schizophrenic, distracted type of perception. This is an intentional gambit designed to circumvent linear strings of deductive statements as the sole, privileged technology for constructing legitimate knowledge. Experiencing the output of someone exercising the Deleuzian method is much more akin to web-surfing than reading.

In the opening of A Thousand Plateaus, there is an explicit statement instructing readers not to approach the text as a linear academic work that proceeds by argumentation in order to create a theoretical architecture from it[4](#sdfootnote4sym). Countless artists simply take this as a symbolic gesture of rebellion. It is not symbolic. It is a literal description of a non-standard set of text-based perceptual habits.

The texts are the output of Deleuze’s algorithm of thought performed on the various objects of interest he was discussing at any given time. It does not function as a set of transcendental principles to be obeyed.

Deleuze constructed a theoretical framework that explicitly legitimized intellectual disobedience, stupidity and dilettantism that allows the user to ignore history, discipline and most importantly to accidentally stumble upon novel, operational knowledge. Deleuze wrote texts meant to be forgotten unless they were immediately useful.

A corresponding strain of thought and approach appears in pockets of contemporary art. Jean Luc Moulene, an artist based in Paris, compresses the ideal of intellectual disobedience into the espousal of ‘authorization’ over ‘authorship’.[5](#sdfootnote5sym)

Moulene’s artwork rigorously anticipates and games the viewer’s conceptual habits for reading and recognizing materials. His work spans drawing, performance, sculpture, photography -- it is not interdisciplinary, or transdisciplinary, it is the performance of non-discipline. There is no possible way to taxonomize his decades of artistic output into a style, career, or unifying conceptual framework because he is deliberately eviscerating his own memory and starting over every time he creates a work. The only thing that unifies his work is a commitment to jettisoning a skill as soon as he’s developed it. This is in complete opposition to the standard model of a disciple working within a discipline in order to accrue epistemological authority over those with ‘less experience’[6](#sdfootnote6sym).

Another similar play in the game of art is utilized by Lawrence Weiner. Weiner constructed a paradoxical artist’s statement within the constraints of deductive logic that allows him to defy all logical constraints[7](#sdfootnote7sym). While grammatically and syntactically correct, the constant slippage between words allowed for total semantic manipulation prior, during and after the production of an artwork -- making irrelevant the standard art game of signification.

My work adheres to this philosophical and artistic tradition of constructing and exploiting logical vulnerabilities that license practitioners to disregard constraints. This approach is non-disciplinary -- it can be applied on any set of rules, materials or actors, by any actor at any time.

This allows me to stitch together materials and concepts in unexpected, illogical ways prior to their acceptance by legitimating authorities. I can speak about subjects I have no authority to speak about. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities are critical in situations where I and others are utterly underpowered in terms of epistemic legitimacy -- such as when one is subject to myriad incomprehensible algorithms mediating every piece of information they are aggregating into a knowledge product. Or when one’s history is wiped out and suppressed by a colonizing force, thus skewing all capacities for proof-based claims. Or when one is a single immigrant mother.

In regards to my work, I have been pushing this exploitation of logical blind-spots as a technique for voicing currently unsupportable thoughts in illegitimate manners. Deleuze’s philosophical thought is simply the easiest and most maneuverable tool with which to do so in this current constellation of legitimate academic thought.

The remainder of this text is the articulation of the line of thought that I have been aggregating for the past few years, framed by the carefully constructed license for improvised thought that is most commonly attributed to Deleuze, but which could honestly have been written by anyone, including the very same non-human algorithms now used to traffic his patterns of pixels across the network for citation in this thesis.

  

When US forces entered Korea in 1945, they dispersed the local popular government, consisting primarily of antifascists who resisted the Japanese, and inaugurated a brutal repression, using Japanese fascist police and Koreans who had collaborated with them during the Japanese occupation. About 100,000 people were murdered in South Korea prior to what we call the Korean War, including 30-40,000 killed during the suppression of a peasant revolt in one small region, Cheju Island. (Chomsky, 43)

  

Following the war, Korea was bombed into sub-Saharan levels of poverty -- the people and territory currently known as North Korea in particular. A leading historian of the Korean War states that, "What hardly any Americans know or remember, however, is that we carpet-bombed... North Korea for three years with next to no concern for civilian casualties." (Cumings, 251)

The Korean war is typically pitched as a narrative of miraculous economic development, one lucky nation amongst others. However, it mirrored the path of other nations that were ‘economic miracles’, such as Chile, in that through a combination of U.S. backed coercion and corruption, it achieved a level of infrastructural parity sufficient to participate within the world economy. My mother and father immigrated to the United States amidst the violence of the 80’s following a military coup.

This is not a commonly held view of the Korean War. This is not a commonly held understanding of the reasons for the influx of Korean populations in the United States. A book my uncle wrote documenting the history of Korean-American immigrants in the D.C. area, uses the standard depiction of the Korean War as a rescue operation by the United States.

The Korean War is referred to as the Forgotten War because it is overshadowed by the adjacent conflict, the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War was a heavily mediated conflict. The imagery of the Tet Offensive in particular was crucial in generating enough momentum for public backlash to shut down the war. Video, wielded as tool for capturing and transmitting evidence, was an incredibly important force in the rallying of attention for anti-war movements. Over the decades, a running game reformulating strategies for mediating ongoing conflicts back to the populations that make up warring nation-states has been in progress.

I explored the current status of the mediation of warfare in _Transmission Fluid_, a video work that submerges footage from the movie _Zero Dark Thirty_ into a hallucinatory collage that intentionally removes and swaps the markers that delineate the boundaries between documents, fiction and amateur media. _Zero Dark Thirty_ is an Oscar-winning feature length docu-drama chronicling the hunt and execution of Osama Bin Laden. My work, _Transmission Fluid_, investigated _Zero Dark Thirty_’s contemporary function of providing a consumer-level narrative for warfare in today’s rapidly shifting networked information environment. In the current state of permanent warfare which operates under the threshold of legal declaration, _Zero Dark Thirty_ is a calculated strategy for crafting a quasi-pedagogical media object that can simultaneously memorialize and obfuscate ongoing conflicts. _Transmission Fluid_ experiments with the visual mechanisms of delineation that render geopolitical conflicts and its associated infrastructure publicly invisible.

Due in large part to a total absence of information concerning the actors and machinery of this infrastructure, my brother, a second generation refugee, enlisted as an active-duty Marine in the first invasion of Iraq, unwittingly fighting for the country that had displaced our parents. The deep well of my brother’s inarticulable anger generated by a war-based culture’s infantile conceptions of value and sociality fed him into an assembly line to become an arm-rest for an M-16.

It’s an extremely violent and incredibly boring narrative that second generation refugees live out and die for in Northern Virginia, a region where the main source of bread and butter is military contracting and subsidiaries that service contracting personnel.

Lockheed Martin, a leading supplier of unmanned weapons systems, along with many other defense contractors heavily support the engineering school of my alma mater, George Mason University[8](#sdfootnote8sym). The workers that graduate from this program are drawn mainly from the large population of local second generation refugees. They are recruited straight out of school to develop cutting edge software for the weapons manufacturers that are currently producing weapons for ongoing proxy warfare throughout the world. One of the most visible is the one currently occurring in Syria. The situation results in a dark comedy in which refugees are building their lives and families by working in logistical and front-line positions for constructing and operating weapons that are creating new refugees. Geopolitical genocide and plunder are the material provider of daily life in the still-wealthy regions of the United States, and most comically so in the Northern Virginia region.

I simulated the atmosphere generated by the conception of everyday aspirations as a crucial psychic lubricant for workers operating geo-political weapons in _Raw Quinoa_. The work strung together digital pre-visualizations of gentrification and the after effects of gentrification, both human and non-human. The text accompanying the images voiced sentiments pulled from disaster relief manuals, juxtaposing different registers of physical and psychological crises at individual and collective scales.

As an early work, I regretfully made the mistake of capitulating to vague mis-understandings of the requirements of legitimate moving image artworks. The work utilized the form of the video essay, a form that is often promoted as resistant to mainstream culture because it requires a high degree of literacy -- but in actuality its contemporary function is to uphold a shrinking circle of specialists that can decode its specific conventions. However the mechanism of the fluctuation and warping of scales and registers present within the work is the core tactic that composes my plays and player characteristics in the game of discourse.

One of the self-proclaimed narrative details of my current discursive player-character is that I am an unremarkable member of these second generation refugees who used the Northern Virginian military-industrial infrastructure to fund my path towards certification as a knowledge worker in today’s cybernetic economy. I worked for Raytheon from 2010 to 2013 designing imagery educating soldiers to operate heavily automated weapons systems. I worked on the DDG 1000, a contemporary automated stealth destroyer. This ship that would have required over 1,000 bodies to operate requires only about 175 bodies through a complex architecture of interlocking software systems[9](#sdfootnote9sym). This is due to the fact that software-based automation allows for expanded and accelerated control of complex organizations from a few centralized points.

The seeds of networked infrastructure today are laying the foundations for accelerated and expanded methods of control in the near future. Increased offloading of informational labor on automated systems radically decreases the amount of labor necessary. The traditional Left cry for employment does not address the technological transformations that are exacerbating the fundamental impossibility of full employment. This tendency for the implementation of information systems to accelerate and centralize control can also be seen in its effect on art.

Currently, ArtRank is the frontrunner of algorithmic art advising. By constantly aggregating and analyzing a pool of insider information, ArtRank sells informational services that assists investors in manipulating artists’ value from quarter to quarter in order to maximize art investment values[10](#sdfootnote10sym). The cybernetic gamification of the field of knowledge known as art will only increase, warping the field of cultural production as significantly as the financialization that began in the 80’s. ArtRank is the perfect microcosm of a field being utterly transformed by infrastructural movements that it has no cognitive tools to understand -- let alone the capacities to protect the bodies that constitute this field.

Understanding that I am operating in a field with utterly inadequate cognitive tools to deal with the phenomena that are affecting the fundamental mechanic of the field, I’ve developed a simple exploit allowing me to invent my own makeshift cognitive tools. In my work _uKnow_, I simply abdicated all my epistemic authority to a childish, abrasive fictional algorithmic entity.

The stupidity and profanity intentionally woven into the work completely disqualifies the statements I make as legitimate knowledge -- thus allowing me to violate epistemic borders and connect multiples discourses with a speed, directness and flexibility unavailable to an academic with typical career-based concerns. Despite the fact that these phenomena are clearly affecting each other on a material level, a complete lack of adequate theoretical tools deployed in an inflexible system of knowledge production discourages any but the most boring, fearful and narrow-minded approaches to unifying these issues.

The vulgar affectation of _unKnown_ signals to peers that I am denying the legitimacy of rational discursive rituals -- often referred to as rigor. I intentionally compress the complexities of geopolitics into sound-bites that include the word ‘fucking’. Paradoxically, if called upon I can repeat the statements with the proper theatrics of rigor, even though I am incredibly uncertain about their authenticity, my authority to claim them, and others’ authority to verify and critique them. The content is far outside the subject-matter of standard aesthetic transcendental philosophical concerns while articulating the higher-level abstractions that are forming the near-future geo-political infrastructure undergirding the daily experience of individuals.

Because of the utter deprecation of authority, I can release this work immediately in peer-based networks and instantly reach the people who are searching for similar, non-standard, non-precious formations of knowledge, and engage in direct, destabilizing exchanges. Pragmatically, this cuts my production, publishing and jettisoning of useless concepts down from years to the seconds it takes for me to rap out a string of vulgarities bracketing my most recent research. Also, I am utilizing the incredible conceptual versatility of the word ‘fucking’, an immanent linguistic ground that is universally accessible across all levels of education. Several responses that I have received from peers and artists across the network have been formed in a similar weaving of the profane and the critical.

Aside from generating incredibly funny, unpredictable, moving and critical conversations, this points to a much more interesting model of knowledge propagation -- in which the tools and forms of propagations themselves are knowingly produced to be consumed, stripped down, and redeployed with complete disregard for the original author’s intent.

Mimesis is the primary ground of transmission on the network today. Brands, styles, aesthetics, careers and messages based on careful organizations of difference are incredibly easy to destroy by simply making them boring with over-repetition. The algorithmic mediation of culture makes explicit that taste, or selective organizations of difference, are simply the set of images that any given subject can recall at any given moment.

In this environment, understanding that treasured difference is easily liquidated, networked users spend their precious attention on methods for increasing their own abilities to author and authorize each other with tools at hand. Shareable capacities for manipulating and reconfiguring past, present and future games of meaning are much more valuable than crafted, preservable units of meaning. Yesterday’s readers looked for precise articulation and clever critiques, today’s players look for cheats.

I see my work as small scale simulations of cheats that can be extrapolated and reformulated for effects on larger structures. The larger scale cheats that I am interested in leverage today’s technological capacities to exploit organizational differences in speech and speed. I believe there is a tremendous amount of potential in re-formulating social organizations based off of existing and emerging capacities of high-frequency infrastructure.

Information opacity as a building-block of organizational systems is often both denied and incredibly misunderstood -- despite the fact that it’s a daily experience. Artists often do not know if the money coming from a grant opportunity to create a project to alleviate poverty is simply using their cultural capital to launder real capital generated by economic warfare. Artists do not often know when grant opportunities for work with communities in other countries derive from attempts to exert ‘soft power’ in tandem with the physical violence it has committed or is intending to commit[11](#sdfootnote11sym). And even more so, most artists, including myself, are completely unaware of the layers of abstractions used by computational infrastructure to bootstrap its operations to the point where I can run the software to produce the images this thesis is based on[12](#sdfootnote12sym). We are very clearly operating in total obliviousness of much of the organizational infrastructure around us -- even as it is operating on us -- always biased towards the long-term interests of global empire.

A common misconception of one of the fundamental organizational systems servicing infrastructural warfare, commonly referred to as law, is that it is a transcendental a priori system that prescribes sociality. However, it is clear that in actuality, informal sociality, simply due to the speed at which it evolves, precede these structures. Laws cannot dictate or predict the constant, rapid improvisation of social formations -- they can simply forbid the ones that it recognizes in its existing taxonomies.

An interesting aspect of the legal system is that it can also be retroactively negated by bodies with no legitimate legislative authority -- thus although most marijuana laws must be legally enforced, due to a shift in public opinion, much of the small-scale infractions concerning marijuana are not enforced. Non-enforcement of regulatory mechanisms is one of the most potent tools for social re-configuration -- and it simply requires improvised, provisional social agreements as opposed to the extremely unequal game of large-scale legislative combat.

The biggest vulnerability in large organizations built off of text-based contracts is that the rate at which they can reformulate the structure of their own internal social agreements, in order to adapt to external changes, is often much slower than smaller organizations -- which in turn is much slower than individuals. Speed of reformulation of organizations to external stimuli is a key feature determining whether it will be able to survive[13](#sdfootnote13sym).

Light-based communication accelerates the rate for improvising social agreements of varying scales and nature across an inconceivable amount of peers. While it would take the U.S. and Russia months to organize their intelligence agencies, ministries and diplomats to negotiate a series of talks delineating a ceasefire in Syria -- a million disparate high-frequency processes for improvised networked self-governance, could be constructed, deconstructed and reconstructed continuously, at this moment, or this moment, or this moment after this coming comma, across millions of peers.

Hi-frequency stupidity, dilettantism and vulgarity are vital for lowering discursive barriers to entry for actively reformulating social infrastructure in novel ways across large, discontinuous, improvised social formations.

Armed with low-cost, low-entry discursive weapons, bodies at the point of geo-political violence could immediately ignore history, improvise an ad-hoc collection of potent cheats and lies, rather than after they had been weaponized, and after their brother stumbles into a graduate art program, only to discover that contemporary art is used by nation-states as a conduit for trafficking arms, and the discursive game is weighted towards legitimating and obfuscating cybernetic planetary warfare.[14](#sdfootnote14sym)

Then the true problem that arises from the age-old militarization and weaponization of sociality can be addressed -- the fact that it’s just so fucking boring.
