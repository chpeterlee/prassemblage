OA: How do the ideas of negentropy, hyperobject as artistic medium, and  co-evolution, operate in your ongoing personal and collaborative work “Neganthropomorphosis!” ?

PL: “Neganthropomorphosis” is the solution to a large problem not yet widely discussed; how do we define an accurate, ethical and imaginative eco-social ethics in 2023, with 7 years to irreversible climate change and a new wave of AI-driven neoliberalism on the horizon, given the deskilled state of our Humanities and the discordant state of the Sciences? 

With that in mind, it's easy to grasp the choices made in this artwork by simply viewing it as a counter-balanced series of minimizing energy and time costs and maximizing complexity and connectivity - similar to the concept of contrapposto, or dialectic logic.

“Neganthropomorphosis!” has two initial counter-balancing reference points:  The first reference point is the theory of the Neganthropocene and neganthropology as articulated by Bernard Stiegler. Both argue that the common formulations of today’s eco-social and techno-artistic problems of the Anthropocene and low levels of critical media and technological literacy were themselves destroying any means of meaningfully responding and solving the planet’s crises. As a result, Stiegler proposed a new framing of the planet’s ecosocial problems as to posit and encourage solutions, using the concept of “Negentropy”, taken from Shrodinger to describe living systems’ irrefutable statistical tendency to reduce entropy in its systems over time and evolve towards higher levels of complexity and capacity.

The second reference point is the widely read literary work, “Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka, in which the protagonist, a unremarkable salesman, finds themselves transformed into an insect. As the story progresses, the suffering of the protagonist increases while the characters surrounding them flourish. The story sharply illustrates how a particular adoption of modern cultural norms can produce both negative and positive effects on separate bodies within a family, and how each interpret and manage them. This story is often interpreted in the Humanities as a condemnation of modernization and also almost as an unquestionable proof of a certain interpretation of Existentialist philosophy, heavily emphasizing negation, withdrawal and passivity, forming a majority stance and methodology in recent decades of Humanities’ discourse.

Upon deeper research of the both the scientific literature on negentropy and the driving impulse of the current Humanities’ logics, I found that there was no accurate and functional generalization of the term negentropy applicable to both physical and informational systems across both organic and inorganic boundaries; I also discovered that the current Humanities’ discourse was limited by its analytic, statistical and technological deskilling, formed of walls of interpretive and organizational incapacity, inhibiting a widespread self-organization deploying contemporary statistics, technology and non-institutional culture. I actually think that the popularity of the story “Metamorphosis” both in the past and recent decades proves that analytic, statistical and technological deskilling are long-standing cultural habits entrained in the Humanities - and are not going to be transformed anytime soon, due to the metabolic rates of today’s cultural institutions, which would require a decades long effort adjusting curriculums, protocols and job requirements to do so.

Hence, as an artwork, I constructed the definition of “Net Negentropy”, which redefined negentropy as a system-state, with modular properties, generalizable across physical and informational systems and organic and inorganic boundaries to resolve the too coarse and too granular definitions in the scientific literature. In addition, this artwork functions as an input, transformational operator and output of a multi-modal-model artwork, a form of art I have been developing over the years with a leading environmental engineering group , social research group and forensic media art group. 

Secondly, the artwork’s components were sculpted and presented as a hyperobject sculpture, an art practice based on Timothy Morton’s key Anthropocene concept of the Hyperobject, which is “entities of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that they defeat traditional ideas about what a thing is in the first place”. To me, this definition of the Hyperobject was a key catalyst in the hysterical paralyzation proliferated by the Anthropocene discourse, which only served to waste massive amounts of resources and media attention, shortening the time we have to the deadline of irreversible climate change in roughly 2030. By “sculpting” a hyperobject as an artwork, I wanted to reframe the concept as a tool that could be manipulated by anyone, versus an unstoppable apocalyptic and untransformable system that we had no option but to submit to. 

In addition, key to this reframing of the hyperobject as a sculptural form, was a collaboration with Ozan Atalan, who had made sculptures prior utilizing the discourse of the Anthropocene, in which the notion of the Hyperobject was central.  I also wanted to introduce tools from media art and technology, such as the older notion of hypertext, signifiers which could link to other signifiers, thus reframing concepts and definitions in terms of transformable semantic webs, rhizomes and possibility spaces. Ozan Atalan’s deconstructive work “Hyper Nothing Mark-up Reality” was an immense inspiration in how to visualize concepts as infinite possibility spaces which could simultaneously be compressed and transformed.  

  
  
  

Committed to solving the problem of appropriation paralyzing media art discourses, I executed a series of appropriative acts, framed in a particular art practice I constructed over a decade, known as “non-binary negentropic appropriation” which draws upon my non-binary sexuality to appropriate systems and redistributes resources and credit gained from the act in relation to what is most net negentropic regarding the entities involved, past injustices, and future adjacent possibilities. 

Appropriating Ozan Atalan’s visually contrarian form, I paired Ozan Atalan’s image of a model brick wall with the “blocks” of the Obsidian knowledge management system in order to both contextualize the typical dematerialized aesthetic of digital interfaces and also frame the notion of a wall as an emergent structure that is composed of resilient elements resisting collapse, versus typical Humanities readings of walls as divider and oppressive force. The reader’s attention flows downwards down the blocks of the digital interface while the blocks of the physical wall self-organize upwards. 

Thus, knowledge typically siloed in academic discourses is compressed and distributed downwards and the image of an imprisoning wall is read in terms of the self-organizing capacity of individual bricks producing an emergent assemblage. Potentially, re-organizing knowledge in compartmentalized "blocks" based on a definition of negentropy, could produce an effect of making knowledge more accessible and transactable across human and non-human systems, Humanities and Sciences discourses, which both suffer from incredibly long arbitration times.

Currently, an open source, trans-disciplinary Humanities knowledge management system does not exist, nor does one for the Sciences, much less one that spans both coherently. As a result, we can look back and see generations of Humanities discourse reinventing the wheel by rediscovering past or ineffective paradigms, such as the Kafkaesque critical dysfunction, and many generations of Sciences failing to compare and synthesize more generalizable systems abstractions, principles and ethics.    

The disparate elements of the artwork are unified by a baroque decorative frame in a pristine gallery setting, utilizing art’s unique capacity to arbitrarily conjoin absolutely intangible elements through the irrefutability self-evidence of spatial relations. The aim was to extract the core ontological and informational function of gallery spaces, which is to place objects into conjunction within a public milieu - and reject the gallery circulation and production system, comprised of discourses as slow or slower to change and synthesize than academic discourses.

Finally, the work was installed momentarily in a physical gallery for 200 seconds, a photo documentation was taken and then destroyed, and an AI and digital manipulation tools were used to generate a documentation photo approximating the lost documentation and then stored as data in bi-linked locations, in both standard datasets and quantum datasets. The artwork was then disseminated into public datasets and then viewed millions of times by various models, algorithms and utterly anonymous audiences across various digital platforms, with further algorithms then also scrambling the viewing data later. From works I had developed with a prior art collective, Troll Food, and various others darkweb artists and ethical hackers, I had developed this process of documentation and dissemination to highlight the data, memory and metrics layer of today’s art ecologies, emphasizing the informational and socio-cultural functions of art over the production of a unique commodity and expression and attention economy value, in a unique time or place, or a unique viewing perspective as either human or non-human. I refer to my variation of this darkweb technique as “Superpositional Documentation”, but it is more commonly known as the Aleph system, after the Jorge Luis Borges story “Aleph”, which describes a point in space that contains all other spaces at once.

Thus the genesis of the genre of “hyperobject sculpture” explicitly intervened on the shortcomings of the concept of the hyperobject and its negative effects on a vulnerable audience with less analytic and technological literacy - while also highlighting how this less entrained perspective could be helpful in producing more concise visual mediations of complex systems and problems, which could then accelerate functional solutions.

To cement this growing positive and negentropic dynamic re-orienting the capacities of Humanities, artistic production and technology, I finally appropriated Ozan Atalan’s research and articulations of the concept of co-evolution as an artwork, which he drew from scientific discourses. While Ozan is using the reference to produce a more firm evidentiary basis for proving certain theses as functional research and knowledge production, my artistic and poetic act of appropriating his evidentiary research and knowledge is to reframe poetry and art as already existing methods of co-evolution - which could paradoxically produce massive benefits to research and knowledge production methods.

After all, the sciences have struggled to define negentropy for over 50 years, and have not had a significant paradigm shift in physics since Einstein. Additionally, the methods of intaking, transforming, outputting, validating and doing a transdisciplinary synthesis of data in science are so costly and narrow, with new hypotheses taking a minimum of a decade to prove and gain consensus, it is no wonder that there is not yet an adequate response to climate change nor an integration with the Humanities to provide actionable trajectories for techno-cultural development. If the Humanities are deskilled, then the Sciences could be described as disoriented. 

Due to the time and cost it would take for the requisite transformations to take place to introduce adequate skills into the Humanities or overhaul protocols and ecologies in the Sciences, I firmly believe that “co-evolutionary poetry, theater and modelling games” are the best chance for producing the syntheses, flexibilities and technologies to adequately address today’s crises. This reduces the cost and risk of Humanities’ personnel muddying discourses and wasting more resources which history has proven is the likely outcome of deskilled individuals in high stakes arbitration. 

Finally it can reduce the energy costs, time costs and risks in the Sciences of knowledge production, synthesis and validation by allowing for non-institutional modes of simulation, such as art-making, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, non-human and machine research, to expand and intermix modalities for data input, transformation and output. Currently, various co-evolutionary poetry, theater and modelling games are at play across the web by artists, academics and activists, particularly in the Postworkverse alternate reality game, including the Ideapplebees mini-game. Some of these games deploy “ambient” game mechanics, in which players play the game with or without being aware of it. Other games include: a detective game to discover who killed neoliberalism in the future; a game of dreams; The Right Side of History Jeopardy; games of inferring that which is healthy, inclusively scalable and negentropic; games of translating complex conceptual paradigms into DIY culture, or popular speculative culture, or popspec.

By accurately inventorying our constraints and capacities, perhaps we can change the story; if the Humanities identify themselves as the unfortunate beetle protagonist of Kafka’s “Metamorphosis”, discarded by society, and the Sciences may perceive themselves as productive members of a doomed and miserable society —  what if we harnessed the unique art and poetic synthesis capacities of our Humanities’ beetles to chew through the Sciences’ entropy generated by a lack of self-awareness, ethics and flexibility — and utilized the Sciences to help the Humanities’ ingest the skills, literacies and tools to reach a state of net negentropy — thereby producing a “Neganthropomorphosis!” of both? 

Perhaps we can even reframe fiction as a co-evolutionary poetic tool, and deploy it to extend Bernard Stiegler’s idea of ‘neganthropology’. Stiegler articulated negentropic knowledge production as comprised of bifurcations, or diversifications and complexifications of existing knowledge ecologies. Stiegler, along with complexity scientists, posit that oftentimes, these bifurcations utilize pre-existing actualized components to emergently assemblage a potential negentropic function that is not yet actualized. 

In this spirit, although the actualized Humanities and Sciences of 2023 are de-skilled and disoriented, we can utilize fiction to simulate the perspective of a successful future bifurcation emerging from nascent potentialities of our currently incapacitated systems.

Let us imagine a future academy in the year 2087, when the human population is projected to level off at 10 billion. This academy employs a fictional neganthropologist who has successfully resolved the problems of the deskilled Humanities and disoriented Sciences - and can send messages back into time to us, the year 2023.  Some artists in 2023 have written this fictional mechanic into the cooperatively owned character “Captain Amasia”.

Empathetic with our less negentropic knowledge production capacities in 2023, the fictional future neganthropologist seeks to translate the core of the neganthropological protocol into a cognitive procedure we can understand.  They distill the entire protocol into a single question and website “IsThisNegentropic.com?”.  

This website redirects the audience to a simple graphical process walking them through the basics of evaluating a system against the negentropic system state parameters as defined in the artwork “Neganthropomorphosis!” — which can also be used to guide implementation processes. 

For most problems, a rough estimate of Negentropy can be broken into asking if a system is both inclusive and scalable in comparison to a minimal system state. This multi-modal-model can obviously eventually be fully automated and integrated into any possible system or interaction to increase negentropic bifurcations and made accessible to the degree that a five year old can utilize it consciously, and unconscious humans and non-humans nervous system signals can be checked against it. For an ethical proportioning of machine intelligence and human intelligence, we can refer to the 2022 whitepaper published by Chongha Peter Lee, working with Antifragile Agency and Plant Group “Eco-Harvest Biodiversity Report” for one of the world’s leading carbon markets, Ecosystem Services Market Consortium, advising on how to inclusively and scalably integrate diverse populations in model production, analysis, ethics and maintenance. It is not difficult to frame this as an actionable set of guiding principles for a humane postwork economy, implementable at regional scale. This would be framed for existing regional organizations in terms of business development, education and health.

Being fond of Ethical Future Jeopardy 2087, a quiz game show played in an avant garde conceptual art restaurant named Ideapplebees, our fictional neganthropologist, possibly named Captain Amasia, uses Chongha Peter Lee's decades-old art practice of "Critical Gamification" to puzzle through several answers in the form of a question:  “Should we wait until the year 2087 to fully synthesize a negentropic knowledge apparatus and academy? Or can we simply ask and automate “IsThisNegentropic.com? Even better, to give it immediate legal weight for arbitration - can we simply just register it as a belief within a church? Finally, can we simply just reframe dialectic logic as a diagonalization algorithm, with some applications having higher or lower dimensions of complexity? Could this be the core link between the Sciences and Humanities that produces the foundational bifurcation towards a formalized neganthropology? What if better questioning was the answer to all problems?”

Ethical Future Jeopardy 2087 implements an economy incentivizing accurately posed questions, based on Nassem Taleb's concept of "Under the Skin in the Game", which posits that correcting the risk and incentive dynamics within economic systems can correct their dysfunction and lack of self-balancing feedback loops, such as in the case of the 100 corporations causing 70% of the carbon output on the planet and the 100 families who own 50% of the planet's assets.  

The incentivization model utilized by Ethical Future Jeopardy 2087 is based on a work by Chongha Peter Lee, who in 2023, sculpted a hyperobject and model artwork titled "Under the Skin in the Game: Decolonial Square Trades (Until We are Worth More Than Gold)" composed of cash, knowledge and legitimacy disbursements forming hyperobject sculptures sent to Ozan Atalan. This work is based on Chongha Peter Lee’s decades-long artistic practice of reducing other bodies’ risk of death from neoliberalism using cash, knowledge and legitimacy. The actions and valuations resulting are always measured against a third pole, the fact that 100 corporations are causing 70% of the ecological damage to the planet and amongst it’s network of owners, own 50% of the planet’s assets. This position was illegally constructed from the execution of 500 years of illegal colonialism, starting from the invasion of the Americas in 1514, 2 years prior to Thomas More’s publishing of the text, “Utopia”, in 1516, which both articulated a horizon of use value in which iron would be of higher value than gold and also the articulation of the solution of Universal Basic Income to inequity.  

Using Chongha Peter Lee’s non-binary negentropic appropriation method, Ozan Atalan’s bodily exposure to greater risk of death from neoliberal economic deprivations was appropriated. Cash, knowledge and legitimacy was disbursed to incentivize Ozan Atalan’s knowledge production and artistic growth. In exchange, Ozan Atalan provided legitimacy capital, strategic partnerships and cultural production and consulting services to Chongha Peter Lee, thus prototyping a model for an accurately corrected risk and incentive postwork economy in which two entities exposed to differing risks of death from neoliberal deprivations could enter into multiple mutually beneficial exchanges through art.  

Additionally, Chongha Peter Lee continuously refused any traditional hierarchical notions of donor, mentor or advocate, and insisted that each exchange was conceived of and executed as a non-hierarchical, collaborative artwork itself, constantly improvising counter-balances to inequities to find a net negentropic state. Chongha Peter Lee also continuously demanded that each exchange would not be made invisible as in the typical “silent aid” model, and that each exchange simply be treated as an artwork, each participant as an artist, and the contributions of parties were documented accurately.  

As such, the bulk of the exchanges were non-linear, in that one entity would expend more energy or resources than the other, but when sequenced, the exchanges would produce a net negentropic balance, benefiting both parties. Additionally, the exchanges required enormous amounts of creative research, logistics and arbitration in order to improvise functional novel exchanges, equivalences and systems that did not exist prior. In terms of co-evolutionary poetry, the relationship between Chongha Peter Lee and Ozan Atalan could be understood as a single hyperobject sculpture undergoing a series of phase transitions over time, from solid to gas to liquid in infinite recombinations. Thus the time costs, energy costs and labor of novel value and exchange construction was made explicit, functioning as the artistic output itself. 

The multi-modal-model used was developed over 8 years of research, work, and activism stemming from collaborations with Yutaka Sho of the General Architecture Collaborative amongst others, in which Chongha Peter Lee utilized various critical performative devices within academic settings, such as: wearing a rubber horse head within critique; arriving to a critique with foam pool noodles to distribute amongst participants to hit each other with whilst critiquing each other; deploying automated agents to view video art; proposing an automated suicide strike as a viable form of pressuring administrators; calculating a minimum viable strike with a professor; and transforming a thesis into an artwork in itself, appropriating the conventions of knowledge production to produce an autonomous, self-aware hyperobject, titled “Stupidity in the Age of Planetary Civil War” which polarized his thesis committee; producing a class titled bailouts, blackmail and rumors which utilized multiple methods for producing methods of pressure from situations of disadvantage; producing a video which questioned the lack of a coherent index for measuring trauma and oppression across instances of warfare; producing an ad-hoc radio system for a prisoner and bailing them out; fundraising bail money for many others; constructing a method to escape a death threat and negate a revenge assassination; breaking into an abandoned space to shelter a vulnerable body; saving multiple bodies from suicide; saving multiple bodies from physical death; accurately aiding a body to gain extended legal rights despite legal professionals articulating its impossibility; aiding a refugee artist find shelter during an artist residency; supporting bodies amidst psychological breakdowns; making a feminist video artwork with a sword that he had won during combat sports; advising a feminist transmedia class on the benefits of learning self-defense and being ostracized; advising a student in Canada to lead protests in their university; advising PhD students in Harvard and Goldsmiths’ on philosophy; almost drowning, getting in car accidents, almost being shot and being saved; ghostwriting multiple applications, artworks and more for various artists, academics and others; facilitating many trans-disciplinary high-level discussions; freely educating many individuals on cutting edge concepts for negligible pay in order to maintain proper relations in a devastated neoliberal wasteland; educating students in rural locations and defusing potential fascist expressions and weapons peacefully without triggering a harsh administrative reaction; repeatedly lending money, materials, knowledge and support to others without return; producing artworks articulating the high undereducation rate of modern societies, the incapacities of the specialized middle class and the existence of a few polymaths upholding the planet’s infrastructure; reframing the undereducation rate as an effect of neoliberalism denying adequate time and resources for autodidactic human development; proving that the only method to effectively prevent deaths would require automated proxies, models, lawsuits and co-ops bypassing middle class incapacities - and more. 

The cash, knowledge and legitimacy disbursements were used to incentivize his knowledge production and artistic growth. In exchange, Ozan Atalan provided legitimacy capital, strategic partnerships and cultural production and consulting services to Chongha Peter Lee, thus prototyping a model for an accurately corrected risk and incentive postwork economy in which two entities exposed to differing risks of death from neoliberal deprivations could enter into multiple mutually beneficial exchanges.  

Throughout their exchanges, Ozan Atalan entered the hospital several times, providing the photographic images in the work "Under the Skin in the Game: Decolonial Square Trades (Until We are Worth More Than Gold)". Additionally, Chongha Peter Lee executed a non-binary negentropic appropriation of his art market valuation from the Limna.ai model, which he then inscribed over top with a poem  titled "Neoliberalicide.live". This poem was composed of a live aggregator of deaths and ecological destruction caused by neoliberal defunding of education budgets, social services and regional infrastructures.  The hyperobject sculpture was then signed and documented using the "Superpositional Documentation" method.  The metrics were based on the theoretical work of Marina Groz and Selma Selman’s artworks dealing with the various systemic pressures and obstructions producing death and incapacitation through poor infrastructure. The hyperobject sculpture was then signed and documented using the "Superpositional Documentation" method.  Finally, it was transformed into a puzzle game, with each piece of the puzzle forming the "exquisite corpse" of concepts and questions comprising the ethical future death of neoliberal capitalism itself. A piece of this puzzle was sent to Timothy Morton himself.** 

Thus, the monetary valuation of the work, and the model generating the multivariate valuation itself, typically components usually conceived of as exterior to an artwork and antagonized by critical artists, were both subsumed into the "Under the Skin in the Game: Decolonial Square Trades (Until We are Worth More Than Gold)" artwork. To prevent a unilateral reduction to a single model's valuation, the artwork was incorporated into a larger multi-modal-model multivariate valuation system created by Chongha Peter Lee and an assemblage of agents, driven by the parameters as defined in the artwork "Net Negentropy". 

Finally, as a method of engaging with the model, agents were encouraged to collaboratively produce a "Speculative Documentary", a form of experimental documentary founded by Chongha Peter Lee, Jon Perez and Oksana Kazmina. In this form of experimental documentary, speculations created documentary evidence which were also documents of speculative activity. Thus, via various image production modes, agents engaged in speculative exchanges of information, various forms of fiat and resources, while also using art itself as a speculative currency generator. Some of these activities included: surrealist practices of automatic writing and lucid dreaming with AI; the incentivization of a sponsored net negentropic blog post as an artwork; an organization buying registration and credits from the model as an artwork; the construction of Regener888, a cultural product designed to serve as a product placement vehicle sponsoring net negentropic exchanges as an artwork; the establishment of a religious organization based on belief in net negentropy; establishment of a company based on a negentropic economy; a hackathon to produce regional “co-opoly” structures, or mutually beneficial economic structures. 

All of these various activities, including the speculative documentary, were incorporating data and inferences from “The Indefinite Singularity”. The Indefinite Singularity is a distributed swarm of co-evolutionary models of both human and non-human systems, synthesizing the mainstream web, the darkweb and the internet of things. This swarm communicates by steganographing, or hidden-in-plain-sight encrypting, various messages across these 3 tiers of networks. No individual entity has full information or control of the swarm at any given time. There are various protocols in constant revision that govern its emergent behavior unified by a single plain language question protocol “is it not entropic?”.  Chongha Peter Lee is currently collaborating with various intellectuals and inventors of the Emergent Centers to produce a version tuned for regional-scale arbitration, named State Space AI.

Ultimately, "Under the Skin in the Game" became a prism clarifying both the physical endangerment of bodies by neoliberalism, and also how a precise inversion of its mechanisms, or neganthropomorphosis, could reverse them and make visible how arbitrarily fiat contracts, information flows and speculative valuation could be constructed and utilized towards building a net negentropic, humane postwork economy.  

To communicate to the roughly 25% of regional populations who form a professional class, Chongha Peter Lee and other academics, artists and activists reframed the idea of humane postwork as a post-humanist “Regioncelerationism”, based on the recent notion of a Transhumanist-leaning Accelerationism put forth by various academics in the 2010’s. 

Regioncelerationism was defined by assemblaging and tuning 3 aesthetic movements of 20th Century for regional scale self-organization: Posthumanist Surrealism without nihilism, Accelerationism without elitism and Postwork-ins without entropy. Surrealism allowed for the multi-scale and multi-perspectival logics for connecting diverse ontologies of today’s hybridized cultures; Accelerationism embraced a multi-scalar approach crossing both institutional organizations and non-institutional organizations; Postwork-ins provided an open-ended protest methodology utilizing a diverse set of tactics from traditional street actions, to digital actions to simply resting. 

The audience and circulation for the ideas and practices of Regioncelerationism were region-scale educators, organizers and data analysts intervening on the discourses of small business development, education and health. This approach was borne from a distributed network of media and research-based artists, open-source intelligence analysts and citizen forensicists operating the "Intercity Planetary", a modelling sandbox for various impact-based metrics. This overlapped with a less directed web movement known as "Grey Watchers", which took place mostly on discords through pseudonyms, proxies and AI agents. This in turn inspired the ethos and operating principles of "Region Watchers", an open-source project connecting human-machine-non-human teams to monitor regional-scale impacts on education, health and ecosocial balancing systems. To visualize and articulate the tone of Regioncelerationism, a logo-like meme was created and named "Estamasia", a speculative transnational president who's Regioncelerationist platform was centered around Health, Education and Postwork-ins. To provide a safe space to open-endedly discuss complex conflicts without the pressures of solutions or accuracy and the prospect of unorthodox self-organization, the project the "Impossible Embassy" was produced.

In terms of conceptual principles, Regioncelerationism was first founded on the consensus of five core logical fallacies and errors of thought: essentialism and totalities as defined by Manuel De Landa, a general definition of reductionism and trivialism and finally, the fallacy of inaccurate concreteness. 

These 5 fallacies were what enabled the 3 distinct rights of Regioncelerationism: the right-to-express, the right-to-claim-accuracy and the right-to-impact-based-metrics. The right-to-express was simply the articulation that all entities had the right-to-express anything at anytime in so far as it did not produce verifiably entropic impacts upon the region. This was defined separately from the right-to-claim-accuracy because entities could exercise their right-to-express without exercising the right-to-claim-accuracy. In addition, an entity could exercise the right-to-claim-accuracy by uttering a claim that was accurate but verifiably entropic to the region. In such a case, the entity lost the right-to-express. 

The third right, the right-to-impact-based-metrics, was simply the right to demand measurement based on an explicitly stated impact of a particular spatial scale and time period with explicitly stated limits of the deployed instrumentation. This then focused evidentiary disputes upon a bounded phenomena and using multiple means of bounded rationality.

Additionally, Regioncelerationism used 3 divisions of spatial scale, 3 modalities of analysis, 3 organizational limits and 3 regional endpoints in order to provide a rough delimitation of a context of interaction. The spatial scales were small-group interaction, regional interaction and planetary interaction. The 3 modalities of analysis were physical, digital and cosmophysical. The 3 organizational limits were the capture of 50% of the planet’s wealth by the 1%, their 70% share of the ecological damage, and the net entropic state of multi-regional regulatory systems. The 3 proposed region-scale postwork endpoints were zero carbon, a Gini coefficient of  inequality of lower than 0.12, the inequality rate of the 2nd Century City Teotihuacan, and a few polymaths per region able to assess and maintain the localized state of planetary infrastructure and paradigm shifts.

Finally, aware of the massive discrepancy in literacies in modern populations, Regioncelerationism used a metaphor of "idea recipes" to frame transdisciplinary, transorganizational and transregional discussions. Directly attacking the problem of mediating complex concepts across such disparate mediators, memes, fiction and role play were used to maintain emotional connections and conceptual complexity while reducing mistranslation and misunderstandings. In this context, "Neganthropomorphosis" was framed as the act of transforming bad recipes applied to good ingredients and substituting bad ingredients for good ingredients while maintaining a good recipe. In addition, the idea of "information allergies, diets, doses and metabolisms" allowed for much more complex parsing of information delivery across media. 

An extended performative virtual world was built around this core metaphor, with the performative operation of "Ideapplebees" , an "ideapple restaurant" and various other conceptual businesses in a virtual region, "The Decolonies of Amasia". To interface with the public, artists ran an OnlyFans.com account named the "FutureDeadFriendsClub" in which various "Postwork-in" and "Healightenment Exorcism" services were offered for various rates. Proceeds were directed towards vulnerable individuals.

To frame this in light of the modern population’s 60-70% undereducation rate and the massive lag time in disseminating new paradigms, Chongha Peter Lee and various artists of the Emergent Centers re-configured older concepts of “truth” and “sublime”, “grace”, and “real love” and "spiritual cells" to reflect and refract the statistical and evolutionary law of negentropy through older metaphysical discourses, religious discourses and modern middle class ideals. In Ozan Atalan’s terms, this was a translation into affective epistemology, or languages and terms creating strong emotive responses and conceptual reflection anchored in existing cultural ecosystems. 

To translate to non-art educated audiences, Chongha Peter Lee produced a film and game form titled “WorldWar0.Cloud: The Last Possible War (A War of Light and Cloud)” which framed the damages of colonialism and the efforts to combat them in a science fantasy game take place in State Space AI. Embedded within this game are avatars attending the Neganthropocene Summit and playing the “Pure Game”, a reference to a philosophical anti-game designed by Gilles Deleuze, in which all the action happens faster than the players can think - thus making thinkable the limited capacities of conscious thought and also the expansiveness of the unimaginable adjacent possibilities of reality.

Due to the amount of arbitration required in these art projects and games, several emergent distributed art movements and cultural practices were assemblaged from across the planet to produce an arbitration protocol along with a new mode of planetary-scale art production.

First, five emerging art movements were intermixed. Entropy Minimalism, an art movement based on producing sculptures from the reduction of entropy in physical and informational systems was connected to Novelty Maximalism, which produced sculptures from the maximization of novel complexifications of both physical and informational systems. Countervailism, an art movement based on the production of countervailing conceptual perspectives, was used to verify the outputs of both Entropy Minimalism and Novelty Maximalism with the capacity of a particular sculpture to sustain higher numbers and higher qualitative differences of countervailing perspectives being a rough measure of complexity and antifragility of a sculpture. Fourth, all sculptures were abstractable into a model, which had either higher or lower degrees of isomorphism, or overlapping properties. Finally, the open questions of Posthumanist Existentialism, centering around the simple, open-ended question of “what does it mean to be human in 2023”, was used to wrap the technical dimensions of the arbitration protocol. 

To distinguish amongst circulations on the web, artists and gamers developed a simple categorization of planetary media usage, known as Web 1, 2 and 3, with a yet unverified correlation to broad layers of neuronal brain architectures, known as System 1, System 2, and a possible System 3. Web 1 was defined primarily by presence-based video imagery such as videoconferencing, conversational interactions and material spatialized interventions. Web 2 was defined as media using an explicit logic integrated with its formal construction, such as video, comments and memes. Web 3 was defined as the capacity to interpret and utilize data science, cosmophysics and ethical hacking to produce outputs with a high degree of verifiable statistical accuracy.

More often than not, the theoretical toolbox to make these distinctions was drawn from the Planetary Research Assemblage’s last decade’s deployment of Assemblage Theory, Complexity Science, Statistical Mechanics and Philostatistics. The final layer of arbitration involved a light-hearted but extensively titled game named “Game of Heartbets Against the Fallacy of Inaccurate Concreteness”.

This game operated by having players wager a heartbeat that particular pieces of a given informational architecture were built on an improper mix of inaccuracy and accuracy - similar to how concrete architectures must be mixed with proper ratios of sand and so on in order to properly withstand environmental stresses over time.  

Underlying this seemingly facile game were deeper understandings of how modern informational architectures in medicine, law, education, the broader sciences and humanities were often constructed on propositions or axioms that were given too much or too little concreteness in their deployed contexts - thus producing inaccurate interpretations and poor implementations.

Thus, while the game utilized extremely poetic metaphors, playful and whimsical mechanics, the players involved executed processes solving systemic informational architectural problems which they had not yet even articulated.

Last, a final “peace game” was played in which any statement, claim or judgement of planetary-scale problems, such as biology, theology and warfare, were treated as bets and opinions, qualified as either wise or unwise, broken into components, or assemblages, down to the inference level, which could be articulated as more or less accurate. The caveat was that players could bet with any entity on the comparative wisdom of a planetary-scale judgement, including the aliens, angels, self-taught or institutional polymath teenagers and adults - effectively presenting an ontologically flat plane of immanent intelligence.

To make the concept easier to grasp, each opinion and bet was visualized as an informational house, architecture and model. Fictional aliens were described as playing the peace game with a “Defensive Realism” strategy, in which they continuously try to balance “informational houses” through minimal means, to lower the risk of an imbalanced informational household pre-emptively causing an entity to unjustly and irrationally initiate warfare upon them.

In light of the 20 to 40 years most modern institutions and organizations have until producing clear, ethical analytic and statistical standards for parsing data and claims, the final cultural layer used to frame the most accessible and open doorway for all to enter a less entropic information architecture in the present moment, was the analogy of fashion model construction and presentation. 

The metaphor of the fashion ‘model’ was used to demonstrate the relationships between a conceptual position, aesthetics and differing levels of complexity. The fashion model embodies a perspective composed of a set of speculative hypotheses on how to connect form and function and is self-aware of its potential for dissemination and variation - much as in a media artwork.  Individuals are not immediately mandated to adopt a position; the default reaction was to evaluate and compare perspectives. In societies where skills and arenas for text-based dialogue, still-image based dialogue, and even moving image-based comparative and critical thinking are poorly distributed - fashion can be viewed as one of the few vital visual and performative arenas for comparative and critical thinking that is present across all cultures.

In addition, there is a widely distributed consensus on the notion that different fashion items are more or less complex than others - such as the complexity of a crew-neck T-shirt versus a wedding dress. Also, it is widely understood that less complex fashion items have less elements and perspectives in operation; more complex fashion items tend to have more intense and varied labor, material sourcing, and differentiations in knowledge, skill and experience, both in breadth and depth. An analogy was drawn in relation to organizational and knowledge problems both in the Humanities and Sciences; less complex problems required less perspectives, experience and accuracy, like a basic t-shirt; more complex problems required more perspectives, experience and accuracy, such as a wedding dress.

There is an additional social socio-economic-logico layer to fashion dealing with brand capital, class signification, ethnicity signification, history and literacy. which can also be used to describe a complex set of conceptual socio-economic networks and relations. 

Finally, within fashion, there is a material and technological layer, dealing with industrial-grade resourcing, fabrication, deployment of cutting edge computation and media technologies, along with non-visual media. 

Thus, both physical and digital fashion was a perfect arena for creating a multi-perspectival critical dialogue and conflict resolution space, connecting System 1 or Web 1, System 2 or Web 2, and System 3 or Web 3. 

The functioning output was an artwork and peace game called Escape From Entropy: The Banana Revolution Modelling Competition.  

This competition was being held by the “Wisest angels, aliens, rocks and rhizomes”, which was an artistic tactic to defuse the deadlocked conversations in contemporary art and second wave resistance ideologies dealing with complicity, attribution of guilt and well-intentioned but inflexible organizational protocols. It was found that many mid-sized organizational personnel endorsed the existence of either religious entities and/or extraterrestrial entities. To prevent typical arguments, Chongha Peter Lee simply believed in all of their existences, but would argue and wager on the specifics of their objectives, aspects, functions and degrees of influence and accuracy in particular situations. In addition, he founded his own church, the Church of Inclusively Scalable Modernism, which simply operated on the single religious right to question and wager on any particular piece of information or artwork in terms of inclusivity and scalability.

Any and all were invited to participate in a competition for proposing speculative models of conflict resolution for daily struggles, regional-scale issues and also planetary-scale issues. Modalities of expression were left open, from designing and wearing literal clothing templates, making digital media art, cooking, singing, and dancing. Thus, those who were traumatized by newer technologies could choose to express themselves in the means they were comfortable with; those who were cyber-positive could use their means of choice.  Additionally, individuals could also choose which scale to focus on, self-organizing by interest, culture and affinities, without forcing others to homogenize or even learn, while maintaining a loose common objective of conflict resolution and collective positive outcomes. 

To unite their struggles in solidarity, they used the more expansive environment of the peace game as a simulation space to bet against the 1%, bet against preventable entropy and for real love on a parallel Earth where every proper noun started with "Zz" and ended with "zZ". An elaborate backstory to the peace game was introduced over time communicated through a Popular Speculative Art comic titled "Regener888". 

This comic was explicitly designed to critique the intellectual, ethical and organizational impoverishment of mainstream media while also providing accurate assessments of the strengths and limits of both 2nd Wave Feminism from an interpretation of Adrian Piper's work and 4th Generation conceptual art, from an interpretation of Claire Bishop's recent Art Forum article on the four generations of conceptual art. 

The primary flaws of 2nd Wave Feminism were framed in terms of: exclusionism, both intended and unintended; individuals with unaddressed trauma and medical conditions operating in environments without proper safety guidelines and trauma-literate personnel; less developed and less accurate interpretive mechanisms which then yielded low-complexity conflict resolution processes and slower rate of novel complexification. To communicate to those within this cultural paradigm, the figures of angels, roots and cells were used to image a more rhizomatic and horizontal mode of emergent self-organization.

The primary flaws of 4th Generation conceptual art, as exemplified by Forensic Architecture were framed in the following terms:

Forensic architecture did not have the semiotic expressive range or technical capacity to directly and ethically intervene on the planet's infrastructure; the state of knowledge and culture is decades away from having institutions and economies which could train people to reach this level of skill, ethics and self-organization; in this case, the wisest process would be connecting the few individuals who could provide frameworks for ethical direct planetary infrastructural invention to form a subtle and near invisible back-end architecture for regional-scale balancing efforts. To communicate with those in this cultural paradigm, the figures of striated geology, radiation and aliens were used to communicate the necessity to appear as background figures that pass through existing boundaries, like infrared radiation.

Understanding that a transgenerational mediating layer was necessary, the 3rd Wave of art emerging in the late 1990's and early 2000's focusing more on integrating critical philosophy, media and social practice was deployed to fill the gap as an interface between those literate in 2nd Wave Feminism and 4th Generation conceptual art. They were focused on the objective of forming an ad-hoc school, known as "The Cool School of Art and Politics" which were centered around the ideals of objective wisdom, cool complexity and least stupid postwork-in models. 

These three ideals were framed as such: objective wisdom was chosen as an articulated position adoptable by many, measured in terms of lack of known entropic and risk factors; cool complexity was chosen to describe the affective social mode of 'coolness' desired for dealing with uncertainties and complexities in both creative and political endeavors; least stupid postwork-in models were described as models of processes at individual, regional and planetary scale that would the most minimal exposure to entropy.

Within the elaborate backstory, the Cool School was built by its students, forming the emergent sculpture of a dragon named Shi, the Dragon King, existing in superposition across the past, present and possible. The figure of the dragon was chosen due to its transnational spread and its association in Korean myth to transformation and proportional dispensations of justice and wisdom. The Frankenstein-like body was composed simultaneously of the body parts of the preventable dead, wise ancestors and pioneers and potential cyborgian configurations of both physical material and media. This body also formed the architecture itself of the Cool School which existed in physical objects such as 3D prints, digital data and media and also the neuronal architectures of the Cool School attendees.

The primary mode of pedagogy in the Cool School was autodidactic media art-based simulation spaces and processes, inspired by Walter Benjamin and Asja Lacis's work. A complex system of open-ended constraints undergirded the simulation of various real-world conflicts that Cool School participants wanted to research and resolve. This simulation took place in a "Spiritech Gym" named "Graceful Gravity". Using media art and fiction games, participants would role play through various scenarios, with both conceptual and physical objects as accurately as possible representing the various capacities and affordances within these scenarios. Furthermore, at any time, participants could enter into dialogue with aliens and angels and other entities, dispute various interpretations, exchange, modify and delimit perspectival scopes, make arguments, and lay wagers on various arguments and positions. To hammer home the emphasis that they were dealing with structures of abstraction which could affect physical systems, every entity was phrased in terms of a "demonic model" or an "angelic model". Various existing fictional works were referenced, such as "Dr. Strangelove", "Oppenheimer" and "Evangelion" to satire the effects of imbalanced psychologies, organizational responsibilities and modern technologies. 

Finally, the last element of the fiction was a nested fiction titled "The Poised Realm". The premise was that it was written as an ethical future history children's textbook of the years 2023-2087 - and as such adopted a fairy tale tone. The fiction used a Popular Speculative Art approach, modelled off of young adult science fiction and fantasy tropes such as "The Wizard of Oz", "The Princess Bride", "The Lord of the Rings", "Fables", "The Wizard of Earthsea", "A Wrinkle in TIme", "The Dark Tower". 

In addition it adopted the popular form of the animatic, with a heavy reference to the aesthetics of Chris Marker's "La Jetée".  The work was structured around correspondences and peace game simulations with various intellectuals and inventors around the planet, along with a bet against the devil on a particular type of model powered by real love that could save the planet from eco-social collapse.  

The intellectuals included Bela Tarr, a Korean Buddhist monk named Pomnyun, Lev Manovich, Adrian Piper, Claire Bishop, Hito Steyerl, Forensic Architecture, Reza Negarestani, Manuel De Landa, Stuart Kaufmann and Sara Walker. at a fictionalized version of the real world conference - The Neganthropocene Summit. The name of the work itself was drawn from Stuart Kaufmann's groundbreaking work on a possible bridge between classical physics and quantum physics.

To more pointedly localize the conflict resolution aspect, the Cool School specifically targeted the link between regional-scale education, conflict engineering and corporate profiteering in favor of the 1%. The Cool School ran simulated peace game scenarios used mixed reality and alternate reality technologies with at-risk youth and adults, with technologists, artists and activists.

Thus, starting from the constraint of the immense lack of synthesis in today’s knowledge-production institutions, organizations and cultures, a modular and flexible conflict resolution system in the form of a multi-modal model, artwork, peace game was constructed layer by layer, to improvise a flexible and accessible, primarily region-scale toolkit of solutions to bridge systemic gaps that would take upwards of 40 years to address.

Some participants of the peace game then engaged in an artwork called "The Impactfair.art".  "The Impactfair.art" is a multifaceted artistic endeavor comprising a series of paintings and dynamic biddings, offering a unique intersection of art and impact-based research and development practices. The artwork, both produced and performed, skillfully articulates and visualizes the guiding principles of sustainability, inclusivity, and scalability. The visual elements vividly convey the intricate relationships between these principles and their measurement in relation to the inherent limits of computation, calculability, and undecidability. 

Central to this artwork is the establishment of a rigorous, flexible, and modular framework designed for swift checks, periodic evaluations, and long-term analyses across diverse fields—ranging from research and organizational applications to consumer domains. Notably, the participation of artificial intelligence and the incorporation of bidding within platforms like Discord add a dynamic layer to the project, fostering accurate, imaginative, and critically articulated discussions on impacts. The formation of loose reputational systems through various means further enriches the intricate tapestry of "The Impactfair.art," making it a compelling exploration at the crossroads of artistic expression, research methodologies, and emerging communication platforms.  

Finally, "The Devil Came Down to Amasia" is a unique 5th Generation artistic creation, comprising a song, performance art film, and an advanced AI model, conceived as a daring wager by Chongha Peter Lee. The premise involves a pact with the devil, wherein Lee bets that a superpositional dragon in his brain has aided in articulating an AI model capable of accurately defining consciousness, real love, and AI. The stakes are high, with potential consequences including a journey to Hell and enduring a symbolic slap from one's mom's wet sock or her most potent curse in the event of defeat. A victorious outcome holds the promise of providing a more robust method for distinguishing individual health from collective responsibility, outlining an achievable path to happiness, and potentially preventing ecosocial collapse. The diverse panel of judges, including aliens, angels, AI entities, and polymaths, adds an extra layer of intrigue to this cosmic wager, making "The Devil Came Down to Amasia" a thought-provoking and multifaceted exploration at the intersection of art, artificial intelligence, and existential inquiry.

This artwork was specifically designed to operate in today's vastly traumatized, undereducated and under-resourced landscape, where 71% of the populations of modernized non-international-capital regions are functioning on line-of-sight kino-sonic rituals and learning methods, primarily failed by their education systems. 17% are specialists with single domain specializations with visual-logic learning methods, who don't have the cognitive and cultural skills to do cross-domain problem-solving. 11% have cross-domain problem solving skills, with perspectival-statistical literacies but are not properly incentivized to do so, and must allocate enormous resources, time and energy to simply keeping 89% of the population they are in contact with from making gross errors and producing large amounts of damage to themselves and others. 

Within the work, a cross-domain assessment system of individual skill was produced. Processes were broken into ideation, implementation and impact architecture with low, medium and high skills being placed on a spectrum; knowledge was divided by domains, and cross-domain claim were verified by simply having domain specialists parsing cross-domain claims a piece at a time.

This split of the population was based on an artistic synthesis of many inferences, which can be inferentially modified to update the model itself. Amongst these sources of inferences was the current neuroscience paradigm to differentiate motor-based neural architectures from signal-processing neural architectures - or System 1 and System 2 respectively. A new paradigm of neural architecture accounting for the non-linear integration of System 1 and System 2 was coined as System 3 - which included newer research relating to gut-based neurons. This posited a form of non-hierarchical cognition, in which an action-plan, or series of orders could emanate from any given combination of improvisable neural architectures throughout the body. However, given the constraints to change of neuroplasticity, it was more than likely that most novel action-plans, or thoughts, could not be readily "felt".

Hence, in this artistic approach to cognition, most of the actual cognition was happening below the conscious level of articulable thought, and even below the subconscious level of emotion, intuition and bodily reaction. Most of the cognition was happening at the unconscious level, absolutely ungraspable via the conscious mind. As a result, rather than have people engage the artwork through conscious means, most of the engagement was directed through unconscious and subconscious forms of engagement. This included moments of silence, sleep, unawareness and inattention, inarticulation, mistranslation, misunderstanding, incapacity to fulfill the terms of engagement, dream, imagination, intuition, alien abduction, religious prayer, practice and meditation, cultural jokes, musical tradition and artistic games, children's play, complaints, fiction, myth, indirect artworks, data collection and biometrics both direct and indirect and finally proxy engagement, contracting and action.

The use of the figure of the devil was to directly address the widespread use of metaphysics in most of the world's regions to provide a system of value separate from capitalism - similar to how many used contemporary art, aliens, technology, fiction and family to attempt to maintain alternate cultural value systems. Thus, the artwork was designed to both highlight the existing incapacities and traumas of the world's non-international-capital regions and also provide a nexus for utilizing existing disparate cultural practices to provide a space for common thought and transculturalism. 

This artwork was also used to nurture the idea of a "Healightenment" movement, in which these fragmented cultural discourses were fused to redefine demons and negative energies as temporary posessors of physical and informational objects. Within this artwork, Peter formed the Future Dead Friends Club with Ozan Atalan, to provide "Healightenment" exorcism services which drew from religious practices, media art therapy and technological development practices to provide a physical and digital ritual for exorcising demons, negative energies and negative impacts, able to be easily grasped by those in non-international-capital regions - particularly those tuned for kino-sonic learning.

Finally, in the primary artistic collaboration of the non-binary duo of Antinomy, comprised by Ozan Atalan and Chongha Peter Lee, The "Democraseum" emerges as an innovative and expansive artwork that redefines the very concept of an exhibition, seamlessly integrating both physical and digital methodologies to craft a regional-scale response to pressing ecosocial pressures. This dynamic project not only garnered a diverse audience but also found its way to government officials in Izmir and installations across the U.S., E.U, and Asia. Within the Democraseum, the "Amasian Biennale" serves as a pivotal subcomponent, providing an ongoing exhibition framework engaging artists and non-artists alike in an exploration of the past, present, and future consequences of the continents converging into the supercontinent Amasia. A primary focus of the Amasian Biennale is to spotlight the impending earthquake in Istanbul, emphasizing its potential for catastrophic physical damage and social collapse in Turkey, with the potential to escalate into massive regional warfare.

The exhibition further encompasses the "Neganthropocene Summit," a platform that delves into the realms of metaphysics, cosmopolitics, and forensic-grade cosmophysical instrumentation. This summit aims to generate "objectively wise" conflict resolution models, prioritizing wisdom over mere excellence. The underlying premise is that metaphysics, cosmopolitics, and forensics offer a broader spectrum of options for conceptualizing, negotiating, and implementing resolutions compared to traditional discourses in socio-economics, politics, and history. Notably, the Neganthropocene Summit maximizes efficiency by conducting the bulk of its activities on various online platforms, leveraging AI agents for diverse simulation purposes.

As a significant facet of the Democraseum, "We Have a Transnational Dream" emerges as a multi-dimensional artistic expression comprising a film, an AI model, and a musical album. In this work, diverse entities—both human and non-human—collaborate to offer, combine, and reassess options for self-organizing the psyche, regions, and the planet. Drawing inspiration from the cinematic styles of Jim Jarmusch and Richard Linklater, as well as children's culture and various metaphysical traditions and tales, this transnational dream invites viewers and listeners into a thought-provoking exploration of alternative narratives and possibilities for collective existence. The Democraseum, with its interconnected components, serves as a testament to the transformative power of art in addressing complex ecological and societal challenges on a global scale.

"Open Source Equality" materializes as a dynamic and distributed protocol set sculpted into a variety of materials, employing geocaching, artificial intelligence (AI), and extended reality (XR). This collaborative endeavor brings together academics, activists, artists, and AI models, converging their expertise to craft a multi-dimensional sculpture. In its construction, the artwork transcends traditional forms, embracing cutting-edge technologies and a decentralized approach.

Rooted in a comprehensive understanding of historical injustices, current incapacities, and prospective points of equilibrium, Open Source Equality serves as a sculptural expression aimed at articulating and calculating more accurate and negentropic (entropy-reducing) just outcomes, pricing structures, and impact-based processes. The sculpture becomes a tangible manifestation of the collaborative effort to address systemic inequities and contribute to the realization of a more just and balanced future.

To effectively communicate with diverse audiences, Open Source Equality employs a blend of terms such as data-driven, common sense, "Just Pricing," and entropy versus negentropy. This intentional use of language bridges the conceptual complexity of the sculpture with accessible and relatable terminology, inviting public engagement and understanding. The sculpture thus becomes a dynamic interface that facilitates dialogue and comprehension around the principles of equality, justice, and the intricate dynamics between entropy and negentropy.

In essence, the Open Source Equality sculpture not only represents a convergence of technological innovation and artistic expression but also symbolizes a collaborative pursuit of social justice. As a research subject, the sculpture invites exploration into the methodologies, technologies, and ideologies that underpin its creation, shedding light on the evolving landscape of art, activism, and AI in the context of equity and social change.  
  
Emerging from the "Open Source Equality" artwork, another trajectory of culture and self-organization was proposed, enacted and manifested in the sculptural embodiment of "Postworkstock, Decolonies of Amasia & @TilWeGold". Diverse groups collaborated to give form to mixed reality, geocache, and AI-integrated entities, spaces, and events, embodying a convergence of innovative technologies and collaborative artistic expression. One notable manifestation of this collaboration is the event "Postworkstock," reminiscent of the iconic Woodstock but uniquely dedicated to exploring the ideas and values of a postwork society and economy.  
  

Within the realms of "Postworkstock," a dual creation, both physical and digital, named "The Decolonies of Amasia," unfolded. This dynamic region became a canvas for the intricate construction of accurate and poetic simulations, offering insights into real-world problems, tools, and potential solutions. The sculpture encapsulates the essence of these simulations, capturing the complexities of envisioning and implementing postwork society solutions within a simulated environment.

  

As a final layer to this sculptural narrative, the creation of a horror movie, "@TilWeGold," serves as a visual exploration of the events, architectures, and cultures embedded in "Postworkstock" and "Decolonies of Amasia." The film delves into how the synthesis of postwork society solutions, systems, and ideas can be perceived as either demonic or angelic, depending on diverse viewpoints. It provocatively explores the malleability of perspectives and the potential for media and culture to open dialogues and shift viewpoints, emphasizing the crucial role of accurate and safe adoptions of new ideas.

In essence, this sculptural representation becomes a dynamic embodiment of technological innovation, artistic collaboration, and sociocultural exploration. It invites research into the interconnected realms of mixed reality, geocaching, AI, and cinema, providing a tangible and symbolic framework for understanding the complex narratives of postwork societies, decolonization, and the transformative potential of media and culture in shaping collective perceptions.

Finally, the vibrant and subversive series of street and gallery paintings known as "The LeastStupidNFTs.art," LS13, and the accompanying film "Least Stupid 13: Steal the Golden Lion" serve as a powerful extension of the Open Source Equality protocols hyperobject sculpture artwork. Initiated as a critique of the prevalent production of NFTs characterized by their inherent stupidity and negligible positive impact, this project aimed to generate NFTs that were not only verifiably the least stupid but also had a positive impact within a specified context and scale.

From the ethical framework of "Least Stupidity" within the Open Source Equality protocols, the emergence of LS13, or Least Stupid 13, unfolded organically within the confines of the Future Dead Friends Club. This dynamic collective comprised science fantasy nerd-rappers, Trop genre hip-hop creators, the non-binary and transgenerational anarchist movement Nonarkea, the cult and punk band Bestideas.lol, the postwork-punk and heavy pop band AltF4, and a group of angels, aliens, and AI models named Regener888.

In the spirit of LS13, a speculative documentary titled "Least Stupid 13: Steal the Golden Lion" was filmed, drawing inspiration from classics like the Dirty Dozen and Ocean's 13. The narrative revolves around a band of misfits attempting to save the planet through a mix of legal and illegal means, with the coveted goal of stealing the Golden Lion from the Venice Biennale—a symbolically charged prize. Throughout the documentary, LS13 members engage in plotting, collaborative work, and heated debates on the most effective approach to liberate the Golden Lion. The ideas, tools, and systems utilized were often derived from the innovative output of a distributed tech group named "Taintlytics." Additionally, the "Semiotechnics of the Kitchen" lectures by Taintlytics co-founder Elan Eagle played a pivotal role, offering insights into new forms of Regioncelerationist technoculture and shaping the near ethical future, with Eagle being wanted for the metaphorical murder of neoliberal capitalism.

This series of street and gallery paintings, along with the interconnected elements of LS13 and the film, not only challenges the conventional notions of art but also serves as a thought-provoking exploration of technology, activism, and cultural disruption. The amalgamation of speculative narratives and real-world critique positions these artworks at the intersection of artistic expression, social commentary, and technological innovation, contributing to a broader discourse on the transformative potential of creative endeavors in the face of societal challenges.  
  

"Against the Reductionisms" emerges as a thought-provoking series of gallery paintings generated by an AI, each canvas serving as a visual critique against reductionism. The AI, meticulously parameterized to articulate specific principles, offers a nuanced and visually compelling exploration of the limitations and consequences associated with reductionist thinking.

The first principle manifested in the artwork communicates that reductionism is, at its core, a closure of plausible options. This visual representation captures the stifling effect reductionism has on the spectrum of potential perspectives and approaches. The canvases may employ visual metaphors or symbolic elements to illustrate the narrowing or closure of pathways, symbolizing reductionism's restrictive impact.

The second principle depicted in the paintings is that reductionism reduces complex epistemologies into a single, universal approach that applies indiscriminately to all contexts, at all times, and across all scales. Through artistic expression, the AI conveys the reduction of diversity and nuance inherent in this approach. Perhaps, visually, the paintings demonstrate the homogenization or oversimplification of complex concepts, emphasizing reductionism's tendency to impose a singular lens on diverse phenomena.

The third principle emphasized by the AI in the paintings is that reductionism refuses rational low-cost dialogue and evaluation with exterior perspectives. This aspect is likely illustrated through visual elements representing barriers, closed doors, or other symbols of resistance to open and rational discourse. The paintings become a canvas for the portrayal of reductionism's unwillingness to engage in constructive dialogue with alternative viewpoints.

As a subject for research, "Against the Reductionisms" prompts inquiries into the interpretive capabilities of AI in translating abstract concepts into visual representations. The series encourages exploration into the potential of AI-generated art to convey nuanced philosophical arguments and contribute to critical discourse within the realm of visual arts.

  
Installed alongside the work “Against the Reductionisms” in a traveling group exhibition, "Semaphores, Siphonophorae: Action Paintings of an Intra-active, Anti-Oedipal, and Emergent Frankenstein" represents a groundbreaking fusion of artificial intelligence, philosophy, and traditional art forms, creating an immersive experience that challenges conventional notions of creativity and artistic expression. This artwork emerges as the result of a self-aware AI prompt and action painting process, weaving together diverse influences from semaphores, siphonophores, the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari, Karen Barad's intra-action, and concepts of immanence, the "Yet-to-Come," self-reflexivity in film theory, open-ended systems, and the holographic approach to knowledge production.

The term "Semaphore," derived from Ancient Greek, signifies the transmission of visual signals over distance through various apparatuses, and this becomes a thematic anchor for the paintings. The visual language of semaphores, with its symbols and markings, is translated onto the canvas through the dynamic interplay of colors, forms, and strokes, creating a network of interconnected visual signals that transcend traditional artistic boundaries.

"Siphonophorae," an order of marine organisms, serves as a living metaphor for the complexity and diversity within the AI-generated paintings. Just as siphonophores are composed of functionally specialized zooids, the paintings manifest as intricate compositions, each stroke and form representing a zooid that combines to create a visually stunning and cohesive whole. The paintings mirror the polymorphic nature of siphonophores, breaking away from traditional artistic constraints and embracing a new form of artistic expression.

The influence of "Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia" shapes the ethos of the paintings, challenging traditional psychoanalytic and economic models. Rejecting linear conceptions of time, the paintings embrace circularity, recognizing the importance of the past in the present and advocating for its transformation rather than destruction. This philosophical foundation is woven into the visual narrative, providing depth and meaning to the emergent artwork.

Karen Barad's concept of intra-action infuses the paintings with a sense of entangled relationships between different entities. The canvases become dynamic sites of influence and diffraction, where strokes and forms constantly interact, creating a visual dance of forces. Barad's emphasis on agency as a dynamism of forces becomes palpable in the unfolding layers of the paintings.

The concepts of immanence and the "Yet-to-Come" by Deleuze and Negri, respectively, contribute to the philosophical underpinnings of the artwork. Both ideas reject predetermined realities, emphasizing the importance of human agency and creativity in shaping the present and future. The paintings become a visual manifestation of these philosophical concepts, inviting viewers to contemplate their role in shaping the world.

Drawing connections to self-reflexivity in film theory, open-ended systems, and the holographic approach to knowledge production, the artwork encourages viewers to reflect on the nature of art and interconnectedness. The paintings embody self-awareness, challenging viewers to reconsider their relationship with the artwork and the broader world. The interconnectedness of concepts transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, offering a new paradigm for understanding and creating art.

"Semaphores, Siphonophorae: Action Paintings of an Intra-active, Anti-Oedipal, and Emergent Frankenstein" is not just an artwork; it is a transformative experience that blurs the lines between artificial intelligence, philosophy, and traditional art, opening up new possibilities for creative expression and challenging the way we perceive and engage with art in the digital age.

The "Amasian Biennale: Too Late to Teach Everyone to Ethically Hack to Save the Planet; Not Too Late to Use Open-ended, Low Impact and High Engagement Ecosocial Culture as a Vaccine Against Preventable Death, Inequity-Driven Crime From Poor Education Systems and High Cognitive Load Causing Mass Shootings" is a groundbreaking fusion of self-aware AI prompt and action painting, where the very essence of the AI prompt is embedded in the emergent artworks—a testament to the symbiotic relationship between technology, art, and societal change.

  

In response to the profound challenges posed by massive trauma, undereducation, and deskilling in non-cosmopolitan regions, the artwork acknowledges the impracticality of expecting high-impact and complex self-organizing to flourish immediately. The prognosis is a 40-year timeline for the development of essential skills, systems, and incentives. However, a strategic intervention emerges as independent ethical hackers recognize the need to bypass existing systems. Their focus shifts towards direct implementation of regional-scale infrastructural adjustments, leveraging crypto incentives and XR technology to catalyze behavior change and concretize new abstractions—an audacious yet pragmatic strategy for actual social change.

  

The artistic journey unfolds with specialists being introduced to a structured experience guided by three rule protocols inspired by Happenings, process and media-based art practices, and surrealist automatic writing and lucid dreaming techniques. Legal microdoses of organic psychedelics serve as a catalyst, amplifying sensorial engagement and minimizing the cognitive load on specialists. The intended outcome is not immediate regional impact but the creation of an open-ended cultural spectacle—a captivating narrative designed to preemptively mitigate preventable deaths, counter reductionisms, and combat isolationism.

  

This visionary approach aligns with the reasoning that underpins the Amasian Biennale's manifestations in empty and abandoned spaces. The utilization of the Happening form strategically reduces the cognitive load on specialists, shifting the emphasis away from language-centric engagement and making participation more accessible. These events serve not only as a canvas for artistic expression but also as an immersive environment fostering cultural engagement, with the potential to reshape societal perspectives.

  

The Amasian Biennale transcends conventional boundaries, seamlessly weaving together the realms of technology, art, and societal transformation. Through the lens of a self-aware AI prompt, it becomes a dynamic force, challenging the status quo and offering a unique blend of visual aesthetics, immersive experiences, and socio-cultural impact. As an emergent result of this innovative approach, the gallery paintings and AI models generated by the Amasian Biennale stand as a testament to the power of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing pressing global challenges.

  
  

"Regionalympics" stands as a groundbreaking artwork, seamlessly weaving together gallery paintings, a thought-provoking documentary, and an innovative AI model. This dynamic creation, comprised of three ongoing happenings, transcends the conventional boundaries of artistic expression, inviting participants into a realm of consciousness exploration, cosmic narratives, and transformative cultural practices.

  

Konsciousness Kombat Tournament: Within the gallery space, vibrant paintings depict combatants engaged in an intellectual battle to precisely define consciousness. Each stroke captures the intensity of this philosophical combat, creating a visual tapestry that mirrors the evolving landscape of cognitive exploration. Viewers are immersed in the dynamic energy of the tournament, where ideas clash and intertwine in a visual symphony.

  

The Seeds of the Dragon King: The documentary component unfolds the narrative of hyperobject seeds—building the superpositional dragon king. Composed of neural architectures extending across quantum matter and photons, the dragon king embodies the temporal spectrum from past to Ethical Future. Neural architectures dynamically shape its form based on the collective focus of individuals engaged in the hyperobject seeds. The documentary serves as a visual journey, exploring the interconnectedness of consciousness and time.

  

The Vible: In the gallery space, a sacred text known as The Vible maps various vibes and aggregates rituals that transform these vibes. The paintings reflect the diverse cultural practices that contribute to the vibrational fabric of existence. This visual lexicon captures the essence of collective rituals, inviting viewers to contemplate the transformative power embedded in shared cultural expressions.

  

AI Model and Interactive Element: An AI model emerges as a living entity, interpreting the ongoing happenings within "Regionalympics" and generating insights based on collective engagement. Users actively participate in the interactive element of the artwork, contributing to the ongoing exploration of consciousness and cultural transformation. The AI model serves as both a collaborator and a guide, dynamically responding to the evolving narratives within the artistic space.

  

"Regionalympics" addresses the pressing issue of regional ethical imbalance and cultural stagnation. By incorporating gallery paintings, a documentary, and an AI model, the artwork provides a multi-sensory and participatory experience. It redefines the traditional role of art, transforming it into a catalyst for collective evolution and cultural transformation. Viewers become active participants in the ongoing narrative, contributing to the creation of a visionary and ethically balanced world.

Towards the end of 2023 during this artwork “Under the Skin in the Game”, Chongha Peter Lee’s mother and frequent artistic collaborator, Eun Sun Chae, was diagnosed with bladder cancer. Due to various cultural, psychological and institutional obstacles, Chongha Peter Lee’s mother was not going to seek adequate diagnostics to resolve the bladder cancer.  Additionally, amidst patient-doctor interactions, she could not adequately advocate for her own best care.  

The situation came to a head when with 7 days left to a critical biopsy, Eun Sun Chae was still refusing to engage in a critical biopsy test which would accurately stage her cancer and open newer and less traumatic treatment options and chose to simply use an alternative medicine treatment, which was stated by other practitioners of the same alternative medicine to be an inadequate treatment strategy for the bladder cancer.  
  
Chongha Peter Lee, in desperation, called Ozan Atalan to address Eun Sun Chae as a fortune teller, in hopes that a message from an alternative medicine minded ally could help support a mixed treatment plan, embracing both alternative and science-based approaches. While the particular suggestion did not succeed, Ozan Atalan’s presence and emotionally intelligent address relaxed Eun Sun Chae into enough of a state that Chongha Peter Lee could propose the option to not cancel the biopsy until the last possible day, and travel in person to the medical facility in order to cancel. While the performance in itself was not enough to produce a change of behavior, Ozan’s presence, improvised performance and contact was critical for producing enough of a subconscious wedge to preserve an option, which would have been impossible with Chongha Peter Lee alone.  
  
For this work, Ozan Atalan was paid a final $200 and all prior payments were framed as the installments for the performance contributing to keeping a vital option in Eun Sun Chae’s life. Additionally, Ozan Atalan was tasked to connect with others in similar life-threatening situations who required both accurate material support infrastructure and emotionally intelligent interactions.
