#### 5th Generation Regioncelerationist Manifesto: Re-aligning the Italian Triforce of Aesthetics

1. **The Collective Unconscious:** The Surrealism of Dali and Bunuel and Pasolini (throw away the exclusionist stuff, keep the spectacular horror, violence and eroticism)
2. **The Collective Subconscious:** The Regional Autonomist Marxism of Gramsci, thinking from prison, along with Guattari's psychoanalytics (keep the multi-scalar and folk-positive approach)
3. **The Collective Conscious:** The Futurist impulse embracing new human-non-human relations (we can throw away the exclusionist stuff, align it with Posthumanism and also already existing animist traditions)
