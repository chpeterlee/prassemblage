-----
1. The Democraseum & We have a Transnational Dream Film Festival use various forms of art to express transregional solidarities.
2. The Amasian Biennale & The Postworkverse & Postworkstock Peace Games use transmediating techniques to directly address the massive public health crisis of neurodivergence through performance and media arts, grounded in postwork politics through transregional regulatory and impact automation.
3. The Neganthropocene Summit & the Devil Came Down to Amasia song pose the possibility of producing transdisciplinary model into an artwork or song that could actually save the planet from ecological collapse, social implosion, murder neoliberal capitalism & steal the Golden Lion from the Venice Biennale.
4. The Emergent Centers & Ethical Futures Institute frame the Accurate self, based on past deaths, present dying, and future possible deaths of crowd participation and a distributed inference-based whitepaper.
5. The PRA & State Space to an autodidactic protocol and self-organizing inferential research and simulation method.
6. Superpositional gallery & Impact-based art of 21st c, superpos doc & verification. In addition supporting art practices of Non-binary appropriation.
7. The Church of just Pricing & Playtheon's Model Kombat.art peace game to determine the appropriate allocations, accreditations and distributions per context, always subject to more accurate information on risks and impacts. Using the blind evolutionary tendencies of play by humans to solve problems, rather than their incredibly low-probability faculties of reason.

Catpatia Piper Place Your Bets:
1. Humans are naturally neuro-chemically predisposed to have logic and reason as a statistically minor function.
2. Neurodivergence = Natural physical evolutionary strategy of blindly producing variations. There is a massive public health crisis where upwards of 70%+ of the population have some form of neurodivergence. 
3. No way any tech-integrated society can work without postwork; a genocide rivalling the Great Leap Forward / Native American Genocide will result.
4. Paradigm for looking at images: ecology of light, or lumacology.
5. The 7 skills of the original liberal arts as good indicator for an individuals capacity to independently navigate society.

1. **In today's society, as in before, reason is rare; perhaps in the context of the statistical majority of blind evolutionary variation, reason is neurodivergence.**
2. A.S.S. - Nonarkea - neurodivergent character who does not have to abide by society's rules of speech.

Through various networked platforms over the past years, Antifragile Agency and PostworkTV.art worked together to interact with, generate and activate multiple sprawling collaborative assemblages, both in and out of art spaces. Here is a brief description.

The Democraseum and the "We Have a Transnational Dream" Film Festival creatively utilize art and regional cultural forms to showcase unity across regions, illustrating how different art forms can foster global solidarity. Similarly, the Amasian Biennale, along with the Postworkverse and Postworkstock Peace Games, leverage mixed media and performance arts to tackle the public health crisis of neurodivergence possibly affecting the majority of the population. These events, rooted in the philosophy of postwork politics, aim to address this crisis through innovative transregional regulatory approaches and the use of technology to mitigate preventable death, poverty and sickness across regions.

Furthermore, the Neganthropocene Summit and the piece "The Devil Came Down to Amasia" explore the concept of merging diverse disciplinary insights into art or music with the potential to model solutions to ecological and social impact problems in such a way that diverse publics can interact with the initiative.

The Emergent Centers and Ethical Futures Institute take a reflective approach, constructing the concept of the "Accurate Superpositional Self" through the lenses of past, present, and future mortality, influenced by crowd dynamics and supported by advanced predictive analytics. The 7 skills of the original liberal arts are used as a predictive indicator for an individual's capacity to independently and ethically navigate society, which then provides a baseline to measure individual neurodivergence against, per particular context. In addition, both institutes use a speculative paradigm of analyzing today's distributed systems known as "lumacology", or approaching images and information as organisms made of light, forming an ecology of light spanning the planet.

The Planetary Research Assemblage and State Space introduce an autodidactic, self-organizing method with both humans and non-humans for research and simulation, emphasizing the importance of autonomous learning and building proofs, arguments and verifications inference-by-inference in understanding complex systems. 

The Superpositional Gallery and its focus on 21st-century impact-based art, alongside quantum-based documentation and verification practices, champion the art of non-binary appropriation, highlighting the evolving nature of art and its interpretation. To determine the scale, period and value of various impact-based artworks, the statistical principle of negentropy is utilized, alongside various forensic data to track an impact against complexity science's Assembly Index.

Lastly, the Church of Just Pricing and Playtheon's Model Kombat.art peace game innovatively use game mechanics to address economic fairness and distribution. They rely on the inherent problem-solving abilities found in play, contrasting sharply with the less reliable human capacity for reasoning, to navigate the complexities of risk and impact assessment in resource allocation. This approach is based on evidence supporting the fact that humans are naturally neuro-chemicaly predisposed to have logic and reason as a statistically minor function. 
 
By weaving these initiatives together, we can see a tapestry of interdisciplinary efforts aimed at addressing global challenges through the convergence of art, technology, and social science. These endeavors not only seek to solve pressing issues but also to reimagine the ways we understand and interact with the world around us, leveraging creativity, collective action, and innovative methodologies.
