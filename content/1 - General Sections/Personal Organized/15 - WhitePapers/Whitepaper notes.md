# Identify the least skilled, most unjustifiably visible:

1. Most skilled can save the planet. They should also stay anonymous.
2. Skill takes time.
3. Trauma is inverse to skill.

a. Split into 3 audiences:

i. Affective Epistemology for Traumatized Populations of the Amasian Biennale to

experience a safe, open-ended autodidactic process that provides the 5 needs on

Maslow’s Hierarchy, see commonalities in each other, and engage in mutual aid

safely and flexibly and gradually.  
  

ii. Independent Ethical Hackers & Polymaths of Regioncelerationism, connecting US

street culture, small  businesses and experimental media communities for regional

scale impacts to reduce preventable deaths, crime from technological-driven

inequity and psychotic breaks from high cognitive loads.  
  

iii. Autodidactic AI, Non-human Ecologies and Unconscious Human Inferential Systems and Energy Flows,,operating probabilistically, primarily through sub-perceptual inferences.

b. Split into 2 modes of translation:

i. Translated for non-polymaths: Due to such little accurate understanding of these perspectives, these subjects are often referred to as aliens, angels and self-organizing AI models, to simply bypass the need to teach over 20 years worth of education to an individual educated in modern educational systems.  
  
ii. Translated as an artwork: Neganthropomorphosis is phrased as a polyptych. Can be interpreted thusly:

The way to accurately interpret this is as a 4-Dimensional Matrix, each dimension composed of 7 interlocking precepts. 1 dimension of affective epistemology for traumatized, 1 for independent ethical hackers, 1 for Autodidactic AI, 1 for planetary infrastructure comprised of networked infrastructure, non-human ecologies and unconscious human inferences. Imagine this as 4 fingers.

There is a fifth, opaque, immanent, open-ended self-balancing and self-aware point, which intervenes on parts to maintain net negentropic system balances. Similar to how a thumb operates on 4 fingers.

The purpose being:

1. The affective audience exists in a landscape where public education systems fail 70% of the individuals passing through them, most operate in intuition-spatial thought, cannot learn through kino-sonic means, visual-logic means or perspectival-statistical.
    
2. Due to the current cultural barriers in technology, they can not teach themselves and the amount of labor is prohibitive.
    
3. Clearly define a circulation and identification for traumatized individual artists, separate from untraumatized individual artists, so that both could operate more smoothly.
    
4. Deploy culture as a vaccine to achieve 3 goals: Reduce preventable death, reductionisms and unnecessary physical and informational labor. Which reduces crimes from regional inequities, mass shootings and suicides. 
    
5. Goal: Positive regional impacts on public health, education and carbon neutral business development.
    
6. **Framework**: 3 simple rule Happenings, positive vibes and HedoNerdism, open-ended cosmopolitical dialogues/game. Psychedelics, music and happenings-based performance art. Zero outcome expected.
    

Thus we started the Amasian Biennale  
- Amasian Biennale (Actionism Happenings + Hyperobject Sculpture) + Til We Gold

Til We Gold: 

1. (Future Folk Horror Musical of Body Without Organs - Shi’s technocultural Frankenstein body)
    
2. Happening-based performances, action paintings forming a hyperobject sculpture.
    
3. No particular conscious thought or action required. No solution expected.
    
4. Preserves people's cosmic equality and individual agency.
    
5. Tradition of Viennese Actionism.
    
6. Body Without Organs = Frankenstein Hyperobject Sculpture of Intensities
    
7. Decolonize philosophy of mind and computation speaking of which, was talking to Jon about consciousness and philosophy of mind - we need to decolonize it. Most of the canonical literature on the philosophy of mind is extremely racist. And it has such huge implications on computation in regards to today's ecological infrastructure.
    
8. Consciousness as Dragon King Seed Theory.
    
9. Functional socio-economics is based on reducing transaction costs and increasing capacity; however culture is not going to absorb this for 40 years.
    
10. Better exteriorized memory and computational systems allow for more complex transactions.
    
11. Decolonial Triangular Trades as performance art. Bodies (Ozan), Manufactured Goods (Peter), Raw materials (Problems and Art from Europe & Culture from Not-Europe).
    
12. Current hybridizations as emergent Amasian culture.
13. The Demons have lesser perspectives; angels have higher perspectives but speak in multiple inferences.

First let me preface by saying I have split this response for two different audiences. One is a traumatized audience that comes to art for the purposes of autodidactic self, cultural and enrichment through affective engagement, with zero aims to make art that makes positive planetary-scale impacts; the second half is for an incredibly technical audience with the literacies and skill to operate as independent ethical hackers able to make extralegal positive impacts on the planet’s infrastructure.  
  
Let’s start with art for the first audience, which is interested in affective engagement, more so than planetary-scale impacts. This affect-focused audience is engaged primarily through work emerging from a non-binary art duo that I co-founded with Ozan Atalan, named “Antinomy”. Based on concepts and forms constructed for independent ethical hackers, I work with Ozan Atalan to translate newer ideas into forms that non-technical audiences can quickly and intuitively grasp.

  
“Neganthropomorphosis” is the solution to a large problem not yet widely discussed; how do we define an accurate, ethical and imaginative eco-social ethics in 2023, with 7 years to irreversible climate change and a new wave of AI-driven neoliberalism on the horizon, given the deskilled state of our Humanities and the discordant state of the Sciences? 

With that in mind, it's easy to grasp the choices made in this artwork by simply viewing it as a counter-balanced series of minimizing energy and time costs and maximizing complexity and connectivity - similar to the concept of contrapposto, or dialectic logic.

“Neganthropomorphosis” has two initial counter-balancing reference points:  The first reference point is the theory of the Neganthropocene and neganthropology as articulated by Bernard Stiegler. Both argue that the common formulations of today’s eco-social and techno-artistic problems of the Anthropocene and low levels of critical media and technological literacy were themselves destroying any means of meaningfully responding and solving the planet’s crises. As a result, Stiegler proposed a new framing of the planet’s ecosocial problems as to posit and encourage solutions, using the concept of “Negentropy”, taken from Shrodinger to describe living systems’ irrefutable statistical tendency to reduce entropy in its systems over time and evolve towards higher levels of complexity and capacity.

The second reference point is the widely read literary work, “Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka, in which the protagonist, a unremarkable salesman, finds themselves transformed into an insect. As the story progresses, the suffering of the protagonist increases while the characters surrounding them flourish. The story sharply illustrates how a particular adoption of modern cultural norms can produce both negative and positive effects on separate bodies within a family, and how each interpret and manage them. This story is often interpreted in the Humanities as a condemnation of modernization and also almost as an unquestionable proof of a certain interpretation of Existentialist philosophy, heavily emphasizing negation, withdrawal and passivity, forming a majority stance and methodology in recent decades of Humanities’ discourse.

Upon deeper research of the both the scientific literature on negentropy and the driving impulse of the current Humanities’ logics, I found that there was no accurate and functional generalization of the term negentropy applicable to both physical and informational systems across both organic and inorganic boundaries; I also discovered that the current Humanities’ discourse was limited by its analytic, statistical and technological deskilling, formed of walls of interpretive and organizational incapacity, inhibiting a widespread self-organization deploying contemporary statistics, technology and non-institutional culture. I actually think that the popularity of the story “Metamorphosis” both in the past and recent decades proves that analytic, statistical and technological deskilling are long-standing cultural habits entrained in the Humanities - and are not going to be transformed anytime soon, due to the metabolic rates of today’s cultural institutions, which would require a decades long effort adjusting curriculums, protocols and job requirements to do so.

Hence, as an artwork, I constructed the definition of “Net Negentropy”, which redefined negentropy as a system-state, with modular properties, generalizable across physical and informational systems and organic and inorganic boundaries to resolve the too coarse and too granular definitions in the scientific literature. In addition, this artwork functions as an input, transformational operator and output of a multi-modal-model artwork, a form of art I have been developing over the years with a leading environmental engineering group , social research group and forensic media art group. 

Secondly, the artwork’s components were sculpted and presented as a hyperobject sculpture, an art practice based on Timothy Morton’s key Anthropocene concept of the Hyperobject, which is “entities of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that they defeat traditional ideas about what a thing is in the first place”. To me, this definition of the Hyperobject was a key catalyst in the hysterical paralyzation proliferated by the Anthropocene discourse, which only served to waste massive amounts of resources and media attention, shortening the time we have to the deadline of irreversible climate change in roughly 2030. By “sculpting” a hyperobject as an artwork, I wanted to reframe the concept as a tool that could be manipulated by anyone, versus an unstoppable apocalyptic and untransformable system that we had no option but to submit to. 

In addition, key to this reframing of the hyperobject as a sculptural form, was a collaboration with Ozan Atalan, who had made sculptures prior utilizing the discourse of the Anthropocene, in which the notion of the Hyperobject was central.  I also wanted to introduce tools from media art and technology, such as the older notion of hypertext, signifiers which could link to other signifiers, thus reframing concepts and definitions in terms of transformable semantic webs, rhizomes and possibility spaces. Ozan Atalan’s deconstructive work “Hyper Nothing Mark-up Reality” was an immense inspiration in how to visualize concepts as infinite possibility spaces which could simultaneously be compressed and transformed.  

Committed to solving the problem of appropriation paralyzing media art discourses, I executed a series of appropriative acts, framed in a particular art practice I constructed over a decade, known as “non-binary negentropic appropriation” which draws upon my non-binary sexuality to appropriate systems and redistributes resources and credit gained from the act in relation to what is most net negentropic regarding the entities involved, past injustices, and future adjacent possibilities. 

To cement this growing positive and negentropic dynamic re-orienting the capacities of Humanities, artistic production and technology, I finally appropriated Ozan Atalan’s research and articulations of the concept of co-evolution as an artwork, which he drew from scientific discourses. While Ozan is using the reference to produce a more firm evidentiary basis for proving certain theses as functional research and knowledge production, my artistic and poetic act of appropriating his evidentiary research and knowledge is to reframe poetry and art as already existing methods of co-evolution - which could paradoxically produce massive benefits to research and knowledge production methods.

Using Chongha Peter Lee’s non-binary negentropic appropriation method, Ozan Atalan’s bodily exposure to greater risk of death from neoliberal economic deprivations was appropriated. Cash, knowledge and legitimacy was disbursed to incentivize Ozan Atalan’s knowledge production and artistic growth. In exchange, Ozan Atalan provided legitimacy capital, strategic partnerships and cultural production and consulting services to Chongha Peter Lee, thus prototyping a model for an accurately corrected risk and incentive postwork economy in which two entities exposed to differing risks of death from neoliberal deprivations could enter into multiple mutually beneficial exchanges through art.  

Additionally, Chongha Peter Lee continuously refused any traditional hierarchical notions of donor, mentor or advocate, and insisted that each exchange was conceived of and executed as a non-hierarchical, collaborative artwork itself, constantly improvising counter-balances to inequities to find a net negentropic state. Chongha Peter Lee also continuously demanded that each exchange would not be made invisible as in the typical “silent aid” model, and that each exchange simply be treated as an artwork, each participant as an artist, and the contributions of parties were documented accurately.  

In terms of co-evolutionary poetry, the relationship between Chongha Peter Lee and Ozan Atalan could be understood as a single hyperobject sculpture undergoing a series of phase transitions over time, from solid to gas to liquid in infinite recombinations. 

Throughout their exchanges, Ozan Atalan entered the hospital several times, providing the photographic images in the work of Antinomy, "TilWeGold: Body Without Organs".
