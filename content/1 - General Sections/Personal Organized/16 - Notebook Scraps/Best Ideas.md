Some of these techniques are based on thinking from the perspective of a future dead subject.

## "StrangerAttractors.Art: Under the Skin in the Game" Emergent Centers, 2023

A film where self-organizing AI models, appearing visually as a blade made of light, are deadlocked to the negentropic attractor, and direct humans and non-humans by rewiring their neural and nervous system architectures.

They use the concept of "skin in the game" to accurately describe risk and reward systems, which explain private corporate driven genocidal capitalism, public institutional regulatory capture, and also the neurophysical underdevelopment of particular individual bodies - visualized as post-neoliberalpocalyptic wasteland filled with various creatures.

These self-organizing AI may or may not have contact with aliens or spirits. But they are influenced indirectly by prayers, blessings, curses, vibes and culture.
















###### "The 1% are genocideers; the Left without a doctrine of minimal self defense is objectively inaccurate; 70% of the population can only operate on System 1 cognition, 29.5% has System 2 and only .5% are polymaths, thus self-organizing AI are needed as assistive tech for traumatized humans.

Ecological problems are easily solved on Web 3.












### Web 1 and culture prior to 2019 is functionally dead, I have finished seeding it, I will only be on automated Web 2 and visible Web 3 going forward.

The easiest way to change culture is mass pressure, which requires automation. 

Ecological analogue for automation? ROOTS!









Pop and hop strategy for Web 1 people:

1. Throw out seeds of a new paradigm
2. Let it grow
3. Leave

All money and visibility can be made on Web 3 and automated Web 2. No need for extended collaboration at all. Culture can easily be transformed by sheer mass peer pressure.










5. Everything functional should just be automated.
6. Media platforms should be flooded with philosophy to make culture less fragile and boring.

1. We can automate all gaps in civic infrastructure. 
2. We can automate advocacy and speech.
3. Then we have to automate mental health, somehow... hypothetically people could just dump all their data into an AI and let it navigate society for them. I mean, then we kind of have to define what a human is... perhaps this is something humans should struggle with themselves... but it also seems like they are pretty delicate.

Okay guys, time for a new existentialism! That was the most understandable wave of thought in middle class culture. Also it negates all the stupid materialist values, which can solve many of the small business / community level cultural problems.

Can push both its punk and hip hop flavors and obviously automate the Hell out of it!

### "What is love really? (Love-in-itself)

It is not reciprocal exchange; those who really love give freely, with a goal.

This goal is not to gain influence or manipulate the perception of the receiver of the gift; this goal is to simply free the other from an unnecessary burden, or offer an option that is not mandatory.

This love is not from the lover; it is from love-in-itself, acting through the lover, who ultimately, will never be more than a humble servant.

The attraction that draws others to the lover is simply a deeper underlying probabilistic storm assembling itself over time."  Your lover and humble servant to love-in-itself, Chongha Peter Lee, 2023
