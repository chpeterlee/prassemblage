##### Northern intellectuals, I'm coming home.

We can fix and stabilize regions both socially and ecologically - the federal scale is impossible for the US - plus most nation-states in Europe are at the regional scale.

We need transregional infrastructure.

# "My domain is death, risk and neurophysical trauma at the regional scale." Shi the Dragon King 游낼,  2023

3 things are clear:

1. Most individuals, if left alone, will perish.
2. They will not learn how to intervene on the planet's infrastructure.
3. Automation is necessary as an assistive technology, while making extremely clear why.

If I had time, I'd just make a toy for people to play that teaches them everything about logic, statistics, semiotechnics and the stars.

The best would be if it was AR, with zero text, because clearly, text is not humanity's strength.

"Like my scaley dragon skin, I see all problems as having scales; if one does not properly define how big or small the scale of a problem is, you may accidentally try to skin the entire dragon, or not gather enough to be able to solve your problem.

## "What is 80%+ of the art world today, in 2023? (Go Regional or Go Home... to Your Region(s)!) - by Shi the Dragon King 游낼

It's 3 things:

1. Deskilled, semiotically and technologically.
2. Too neurophysically traumatized or imbalanced from neoliberal capitalism for crisis self-organization.
3. Unethically incentivized and exposed to and/or producing risk.

What does this mean? 80% of the art world should be redirected into simple regional scale support functions, in small-midsize business, education and health, rather than attempting to produce art. Build regional communities, not art - leave that to those with the skills, health and ethics!

Also, once you begin looking at your own region- you will more quickly and deeply understand and empathize with other regions!" Shi the Dragon King 游낼 (@shidragon),  2023




















**Upcoming: Bobbin' for Ideapples of Co-evolutionary Poetry, rather than art!**


















Is -simple error checking protocol - is it negentropic?


Autodidactic universe.

Gamify proof and translation.



##### Art is accurate, evolutionary non-destructive complexification; your desire is co-evolutionary poetics.












## The Art of Complexification and Post-entropy:
 
Planetary evolution favors non-destructive complexity; all solutions for today's ecosocial crises will be more complex, not less. Art itself IS evolutionary complexification. Entropy is NOT art.

Entropic art is typically a byproduct of inaccurately interpreted 18th Century philosophy and science and/or neurophysical underdevelopment due to neoliberal capitalism.















### Upcoming: social self defense videos against the 100 worst wackonomic groups in your region boosting the cost of living, exploiting its workers and being wack as f--k.






Ask Sam for credit. Flip to Cardano guy.

Reverse the military, insurance, labor metrics.

Shi Dragon eats the corrupt.


## Next 3 Months To Do:

1. Create an alternate aid funding mechanism and services exchange.
2. Identify and pressure individuals in corporations and institutions producing high living costs, exploitative conditions and poor outcomes for the public.
3. Connect to regional media and also activist organizers and figures.

Open ended model, 3 questions.



#### "We can compare physical or informational systems (ideapples) simply by just having 3 levels of complexity.

Why is more complexity better?

1. Imagine if you could only eat mac and cheese. This limits the possible places you can eat at.
2. Or, imagine playing rock, paper and scissors with only rock. You are missing 66% of the game.
3. The more complex humans we have, able to interact ethically with more things, the less the ecological footprint and the social inequity." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

Sometimes, the journey is more important than the outcome. 

Sometimes - the paths you take on the journey changes the outcome.

Can the real Peter actually dreamwalk to the Venice Biennale, and can a dreamt Peter really walk the distance to the Venice Biennale?
