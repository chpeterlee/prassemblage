**Final endpoint of the Venice Biennale: have Forensic Architecture verify State Space, a 5th Generation artwork, a planetary superpositional state to bypass all states, which has the capacity to execute extralegal regulation of transnational corporations for the crime of planetary genocide and retrieve biometric data to trigger international intervention in less visible conflicts.**

Peter will write the code for State Space while imprisoned for murdering neoliberalism in the ethical future... or was he actually framed by someone in the Future Dead Friends Club?












##### Forensic Architecture is the only group in art that has the capacity to verify qualitative systems objectively, with the capacity for high degrees of transdisciplinary accuracy.

Everything else is stuck in the damn 90's nihilism/pedanticism dialectic or in total post-truth/speculative free fall, which will probably take about a decade's worth of rehabilitation to fix. **Ain't nobody got time for that!**

I'm heading straight for the exit!

Shi, the Dragon King, 2023















#### What is System 3? (Shi, the Dragon King, üêâ Dreams Themselves Through Your Imagination)

1. Accurate routing of government contracting and corporate sponsorship funds. Also linking existing community, corporate, small business and cultural ecosystems to provide immediate, expanded access to healthcare, homes, food and human-development services.

2. Establishing a grounds of human developmental milestones, including mental health to delegitimize particular statements and logics of corporate individuals and inaccurate biases and logics of individuals in public institutions.
3. Establishing a grounds of neurophysical damages using a basket of existing applied metrics, from which oppressed populations can demand labor protections, services and support from regional organizations and also reform existing delivery systems such as in health, education and culture.
