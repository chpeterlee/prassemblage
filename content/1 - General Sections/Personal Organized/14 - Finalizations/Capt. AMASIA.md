What is the pay-off for proving something within the Humanities?

1. There's no proof system. You just make arguments.
2. There's no accuracy arbitration system. Everything gets misinterpreted.
3. There's no pipeline for advising or policy construction. We have to make cryptic art objects.














Humanities and sciences academics can do educating, coordinating and collaborating with vulnerable populations and giving regional guidance - it's just a public version of the service economy, for better or for worse.


----

Computation and invention is not the strong suit of the Humanities or industry, and it's going to get worse, judging from the rising deskilling and specialization.

This leaves them process-blind and slow to change ... also why there's almost zero chance of a sudden enlightenment or re-organization.









This only really leaves steganography.

So that leaves ... 

Cherry picking, circulating something they can't appropriate, minimizing contact as much as possible.

2. Games and role play and advice for regionalists.
3. In person aid, weird collabs and street art (70%).



## How does Antifragile Agency work?

1. Rapidly prototype the solution via media art and rigorous debate between diverse and complex perspectives from leaders of their field. *(We locate and connect individuals who are driving 80% of the new synthesis in their domains).*
2. Create consensus on the problem via role play and fiction. *(A technique commonly deployed by think tanks for both the military and corporations).*
3. Aid, play and collaboratively construct the solution with the most vulnerable stakeholders affected by the problem. *(We use inclusive and scalable transcultural and transorganizational protocols to effectively deliver resources, build trust and transfer skills).*

**Backdrop of the film : "Indefinite Singularity: The Ethical Futures Institute"**

3 high level problems (solutions later proposed by Captain Amasia aka Elan Semiotechne)

1. Industry and governance has no know-how for self-evaluation, simulation and experimentation; there is extremely low likelihood of an infrastructural shift without direction.
2. The Humanities is more and more deskilled and specialized over time and is quickly turning into a survival of the fittest of the traumatized competition (Hito Steyerl and Adrian Piper); Sciences have not had a big paradigm shift of synthesis since Einstein.
3. By70% of the population is traumatized, undereducated and vulnerable; 29.5% are specialists. A new paradigm shift released in this environment would  most likely simply be used to increase the power of wealth and influence of one organization over another, or be adopted en masse and then used inaccurately and eventually unethically by individuals who are neurochemically imbalanced.




















Postwork Industrial Revolution Funding:

1. Education = Health care for vulnerable.
2. Community work = Defense from domestic terrorists , aka mass shooters.
3. Media art = Tech to negate the massive bureaucratic inflexibility of 90% of organizations.

Captain Amasia, 2023

It's fiction, guys, don't call the reductionist police.












Aliens land and articulate a theory:

1. 80% of human populations can only communicate through in person performance. They can operate in a service economy.
2. 15% can work through textual and visual abstractions. They can function in a freelance digital economy.
3. 5% are polymaths who can use logic, statistics and improvise in any culture. They can save the planet.











Deskilled artists & undereducated publics. How do we automate this?















Forget Critical Culture:

1. 99% of artists are too deskilled and inaccurate to save the planet.
2. Also, 80% of people are too undereducated to learn. This is also why they are insane and miserable.
3. Let's throw the critical stuff away, and just throw a game at them! 
4. The artists are too helpless and the people are too undereducated. In 40 years, we could possibly have a widespread critical culture. At this point, no.
5. In 2023, AI has to fix the planet, and humans; humans just need to be distracted.














What can art do that hacking and polymath skill can't? 

1. It encourages misinterpretation and poetic inaccuracy, inviting a diversity of perspectives.
2. For most working in older generations of culture in 2nd world regions, they are waiting for this type of invitation in order to express themselves.
3. Why not just code a game instead? Distributing the literacy for art would take forever.

"Ongoing open skill-based performance art call and documentary by Chongha Peter Lee and various 7 year old children: everyone who can actually save the planet, artist or non-artist, raise your hand, for the sake of various 7 year old children", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023
















"**The Polymath Rapture Film Scene**: 
A film where the sky opens up and light beams shine on the few polymaths on Earth, less than .5% of its population, who could actually invent and build the technology to prevent ecosocial collapse, and a few journalists with PhD's who could actually understand the importance of doing so.

Everyone else talks elsewhere, knowing that this is the only conversation on Earth that could actually save the planet (which they are free to attribute as much or as little importance to, thus revealing their degree of self-awareness). "

Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

















For sure, let's throw out 2 ideas:

1. There will be some type of sudden wave of literacy overtaking 80% of the population.
2. There will be a sudden wave of accuracy overtaking 15% of the population who are not visually literate.

For Population 1 - the best thing to use is magic tricks and machines on them - they can really only perceive objects and performance.

Population 2 only perceives short texts and sound - sound and poetry is really the best here. 











How to talk to the population:

1. 80% of the population can only perceive objects and performances. 

2. 15% can only perceive short texts and sound.

3. 5% can do statistical modelling and spatial computation. (This is Peter's home.)











----

1. Because 70% of the population don't have the requisite literacy - they are incapable of operating in a visual culture... so that's totally out the window.
2. Locomotion is out the window also, as is any degree of precise building.
3. I mean, imagine you have a crapton of chickens üêî.  I would just have fun with them - like do magic tricks and hypnosis. It's impossible to teach them, they're screwed.















Producing technologies to prevent planetary ecosocial collapse would only come from outside of this population - from groups that are capable of textual, visual and statistical mediation.

The more accurate actions would just occur without their awareness.

##### "The Monads: World War 0" Chongha Peter Lee & Antinomy, 2023

A superluminal film by Chongha Peter Lee and the Emergent Centers, in which the avant garde who comprise 5% of the planet's population (including Capatain Amasia), are self aware of their inheritance as the prophesied 7th generation since the start of World War 0, the illegal colonial war that began in 1516.

They partially function as avatars for decolonial pirate alien shamans of the 0th World, back from the year 2087, stranded in the neoliberalpocalyptic wastelands of 2023, tasked with a mission from the Ethical Futures Institute of 2087 to use tech, media and art to fight Zombinaries, Ghostlinearities and the Inaccurati, produce a Negentropic Realist and Negentropic Humanist cultural movement, lead successful regional scale revolutions across the planet through 5th Generation artworks and the Church of Inclusively Scalable Modernism, assassinate neoliberalism and end WW0 via peace games ‚Äî and then return back to the future, which will require them to construct the theory to locate the Center of the Universe to power their time travel.

Hedonerdism is hedonism + nerds. This means using the fearsome and unholy power of intelligence to research, articulate and prototype pleasurable practices, protocols and systems. Thus, it automatically puts a human in balance, by encouraging them to use their surplus energy towards naturally individuating functions, who's possible damages can be safely quarantined, and who's possible rewards can be communicated simply through a media object documenting the process. 
Simultaneously, they accidentally become less stupid, thus reducing the risks of stupid shit like mass shootings, fascism and collapse.

They may or may not be supplied by aliens with antifragile technology, negentropic magicks and greater complexity cultures to prevent planetary ecosocial collapse, unethical tech-driven inequity, and usher in an unprecedented age of regional peace, real love, and accurate and ethical imagination.
