1. Everyone's inner self is 13 years old. The medium of 13 year olds is money, drugs and media. They don't care about nice things. They don't even care about bad things; they are simply moving from dopamine rush to dopamine rush with as much money as they can take, as loud as they can.
2. Every 13 year old has 3 personalities which are constantly struggling for control: a crappy and angsty 13, a brilliant and creative 13, a wise and forgiving 13.
3. Every problem on the planet can be attributed to the crappy inner 13 year old; any possible solution to the problems of the planet has to be able to be implemented by brilliant and wise 13 year olds.
