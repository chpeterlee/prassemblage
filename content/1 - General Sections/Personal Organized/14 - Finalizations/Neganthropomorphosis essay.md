OA: How do the ideas of negentropy, hyperobject as artistic medium, and  co-evolutionary poetry, operate in your ongoing personal and collaborative work “Neganthropomorphosis” ?

PL: “Neganthropomorphosis” has two primary reference points:  The first reference point is the theory of the Neganthropocene and neganthropology as articulated by Bernard Stiegler. Both argue that the common formulations of today’s eco-social and techno-artistic problems of the Anthropocene and low levels of critical media and technological literacy were themselves destroying any means of meaningfully responding and solving the planet’s crises. As a result, Stiegler proposed a new enframing of the planet’s ecosocial problems as to posit and encourage solutions, using the concept of “Negentropy”, taken from Shrodinger to describe living systems’ irrefutable statistical tendency to reduce entropy in its systems over time and evolve towards higher levels of complexity and capacity.

The second reference point is the widely read literary work, “Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka, in which the protagonist, a unremarkable salesman, finds themselves transformed into an insect. As the story progresses, the suffering of the protagonist increases while the characters surrounding them flourish. The story sharply illustrates how a particular adoption of modern cultural norms can produce both negative and positive effects on separate bodies within a family, and how each interpret and manage them. This story is often interpreted in the Humanities as a condemnation of modernization and also almost as an unquestionable proof of a certain interpretation of Existentialist philosophy, heavily emphasizing negation, withdrawal and passivity, forming a majority stance and methodology in recent decades of Humanities’ discourse.

Upon deeper research of the both the scientific literature on negentropy and the driving impulse of the current Humanities’ logics, I found that there was no accurate and functional generalization of the term negentropy applicable to both physical and informational systems across both organic and inorganic boundaries; I also discovered that the current Humanities’ discourse was limited by its analytic, statistical and technological deskilling, forming an isolated prison of interpretive and organizational incapacity, inhibiting a widespread self-organization utilizing statistics, technology and non-institutional culture. I actually think that the popularity of the story “Metamorphosis” both in the past and recent decades proves that analytic, statistical and technological deskilling are long-standing cultural habits entrained in the Humanities - and are not going to be transformed anytime soon, due to the metabolic rates of today’s cultural institutions, which would require a decades long effort adjusting curriculums, protocols and job requirements to do so.

Hence, as an artwork, I constructed the definition of “Net Negentropy”, which redefined negentropy as a system-state, with modulatable properties, generalizable across physical and informational systems and organic and inorganic boundaries to resolve the too coarse and too granular definitions in the scientific literature. In addition, this artwork functions as an input, transformational operator and output of a multi-modal-model artwork, a form of art I have been developing over the years with a leading environmental engineering group , social research group and forensic media art group. 

Secondly, the artwork’s components were sculpted and presented as a hyperobject sculpture, an art practice based on Timothy Morton’s key Anthropocene concept of the Hyperobject, which is “entities of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that they defeat traditional ideas about what a thing is in the first place”. To me, this definition of the Hyperobject was a key catalyst in the hysterical paralyzation proliferated by the Anthropocene discourse, which only served to waste massive amounts of resources and media attention, shortening the time we have to the deadline of irreversible climate change in roughly 2030. By “sculpting” a hyperobject as an artwork, I wanted to reframe the concept as a tool that could be manipulated by anyone, versus an unstoppable apocalyptic and untransformable system that we had no option but to submit to. 

In addition, key to this reframing of the hyperobject as a sculptural form, was a collaboration with Ozan Atalan, who had made sculptures prior utilizing the discourse of the Anthropocene, in which the notion of the Hyperobject was central.  I also wanted to introduce tools from media art and technology, such as the older notion of hypertext, signifiers which could link to other signifiers, thus reframing concepts and definitions in terms of transformable semantic webs, rhizomes and possibility spaces. Ozan Atalan’s deconstructive work “Hyper Nothing Mark-up Reality” was an immense inspiration in how to visualize concepts as infinite possibility spaces which could simultaneously be compressed and transformed. 

Thus the genesis of the genre of “hyperobject sculpture” explicitly intervened on the shortcomings of the concept of the hyperobject and its negative effects on a vulnerable audience with less analytic and technological literacy - while also highlighting how this less entrained perspective could be helpful in producing more concise visual mediations of complex systems and problems, which could then accelerate functional solutions.

To cement this growing positive and negentropic dynamic re-orienting the capacities of Humanities, artistic production and technology, I finally appropriated Ozan Atalan’s research and articulations of the concept of co-evolution as an artwork, which he drew from scientific discourses. While Ozan is using the reference to produce a more firm evidentiary basis for proving certain theses as functional research and knowledge production, my artistic and poetic act of appropriating his evidentiary research and knowledge is to reframe poetry and art as already existing methods of co-evolution - which could paradoxically produce massive benefits to research and knowledge production methods.

After all, the sciences have struggled to define negentropy for over 50 years, and have not had a significant paradigm shift in physics since Einstein. Additionally, the methods of intaking, transforming, outputting, validating and doing a transdisciplinary synthesis of data in science are so costly and narrow, with new hypotheses taking a minimum of a decade to prove and gain consensus, it is no wonder that there is not yet an adequate response to climate change nor an integration with the Humanities to provide actionable trajectories for techno-cultural development. If the Humanities are deskilled, then the Sciences could be described as disoriented. 

Due to the time and cost it would take for the requisite transformations to take place to introduce adequate skills into the Humanities or overhaul protocols and ecologies in the Sciences, I firmly believe that “co-evolutionary poetry” is the best chance for producing the syntheses, flexibilities and technologies to adequately address today’s crises. This reduces the cost and risk of Humanities’ personnel muddying discourses and wasting more resources which history has proven is the likely outcome of deskilled individuals in high stakes arbitration. Finally it can reduce the energy costs, time costs and risks in the Sciences of knowledge production, synthesis and validation by allowing for non-institutional modes of simulation, such as art-making, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, non-human and machine research, to expand and intermix modalities for data input, transformation and output.

By accurately inventorying our constraints and capacities, perhaps we can change the story; if the Humanities identify themselves as the unfortunate beetle protagonist of Kafka’s “Metamorphosis”, discarded by society, and the Sciences may perceive themselves as productive members of a doomed and miserable society —  what if we harnessed the unique art and poetic synthesis capacities of our Humanities’ beetles to chew through the Sciences’ entropy generated by a lack of self-awareness, ethics and flexibility — and utilized the Sciences to help the Humanities’ ingest the skills, literacies and tools to reach a state of net negentropy — thereby producing a “Neganthropomorphosis” of both?**
