Cool School is surrealist technique


Well, time to crank the machine.











Perhaps we can just split into:

1. People capable of working accurately with abstractions. 
2. People who aren't. (Give these people drugs, not education.)

























# The Undeading: Postworkverse (Film of the Game)

POV: just another nice person.

1. You're tending to your own life; you haven't heard much from that crazy guy Peter, or Captain Amasia. 
2. Seems like something is happening. Ideapplebees is getting busier. The Ethical Futures Institute is reporting progress on the development of Negentropic Reality Technologies. The Intercity Planetary Council of Consilience is working through its backlog. 
3. Your small tribe is stable, but bored. Join the Postworkverse, an alternate reality game where you can link up with other small tribes to build, trade and share stories. If you choose, take part in quests to gain access to greater spaces and fight off hordes of Zombinaries using art! Mix any mixture of characters and abilities from any possible story! Build post-neoliberalpocalyptic technology and culture to strengthen your region! Film absurd semi-real and semi-fictional scenes!



















# This Fall, in a space in your region near you! 

## The Democraseum Project: Connecting Third Places, Third Cultures and Third Systems.













### Upcoming: Peter exits stage, works purely on technical solutions to saving the planet. Enter all the Humanities intellectuals for an open forum!















#### What actually saves the planet?

In the end it's just a bunch of extremely invisible, extremely boring and complex computer viruses. 

**Think decolonial Stux Net.**

The rest of this stuff is just to keep people alive and well before they come online.
















## "The Realist: Indefinite Singularity (World War 0)"

A speculative documentary of an individual character, Captain Amasia, in an underground planetary game who is the avatar of an alien culture Back From the Ethical Futures Institute, 2087.

Captain Amasia can:
- Interchange between the first person perspective of any body, project and hand-hold an imagined 3rd person perspective and enter the perspective of reality itself.
- Re-invent personal health praxes and philosophies, recombines multiple cultures of dance, song and combat, and reinvents clothing, architecture, art, media, tech and ecologies.
- Lives a nomadic life connecting regional 3rd spaces, 3rd cultures and 3rd systems across the planet while simultaneously coordinating non-lethal sabotage and cyber attacks at the 100 worst corporations and families of the world, the war criminals of World War 0, the illegal colonial war which started in 1514.

















#### "Why not downsize the 100 corporations doing 70% of the ecological damage to the planet and sue the 100 families who stole 50% of the planet's wealth through 500 years of illegal colonial warfare? Then use that to fund regional services and infrastructure?" Captain Amasia, 2023















### "Breaking News From Amasia.live: Dr. Dopeman üêò Has Diagnosed The World Tumor: the 100 corporations committing 70% of the ecological destruction and 100 families of neoliberalism who own 50% of the planet's wealth. Surgery begins this Winter." Dr. Dopeman, 2023











With my shitty smartphone, 3 speakers and 3 cheap projectors, I'm quite sure I can make a 9 minute video destroying every stupid misconceived boundary between ecology, society, tech and art - basically problems worth billions of dollars.

The Realist: A film of the Indefinite Singularity Negentropic Reality Game


1. Ontological aliens - gods perspective
2. Dreams - remote viewing and camera
3. Semiotechne- imagination as inferential encryption







##### "Anti-Master's Class Part 3:
every night, you dream, fearlessly facing the Sublime of reality, and compute/calculate more adjacent possibilities than any quantum supercomputer possibly could. How do we translate your natural superpowers into waking life?" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023


















-----

### Update - all accurate complexity is moving elsewhere - to the Emergent Centers.

If the theory is accurate, it should prove itself by being able to produce solutions, explain events and predict future phenomena.

Antifragile Agency will continue to release short, digestible mind openers.

##### "Humanities or Sciences without a statistical epistemology is modern phrenology, but worse." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

Guys, clearly, letting people produce knowledge without literacy of statistics is like letting a blind and drunk infant fly a plane.

Is it negentropic? No.












## "The Sublime of Adjacent Possible Stupidity" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

There are always incomputable, incalculable adjacent possibilities that every given perspective is too sublimely stupid to grasp; hence lack will always be in a subject's method of apprehension, not in reality.

Stupid is not bad nor good; it is simply stupid - a perspective with minimal or incomplete information.

(Also, if you feel bad for being associated with stupidity, you can always just point at Peter who, as an art project, will vouch for you that at least you are less stupid than him).











# "Accurate Economics for the 21st Century:

Level 1: The Physical Product Economy (Teach via toy-making and performance art)
Level 2: The Services Economy (Teach via Medi and Dream)
Level 3: The Incentive, Risk and Model Correction Postwork Economy (Teach via Jeopardy and wagers)", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023















"Video 3 of the Anti-Master's Class: as a field, art is 99% allergic to new culture and technology", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

If you want to make new stuff, don't do it in art!





### "The actual makeup of the art world, which is pretty much the same in any field:

1. 70% are there for therapy and shelter, because neoliberalism cut all the state funded programs and services.
2. 29.5% are specialists, and can do one thing well. Without a proper program, they won't learn; if you leave them to their own devices, they will become entropic. The solution is to give them an automated general purpose tool for accuracy and ethics and then aim them at producing media.
3. .5% are autonomous nomadic polymaths and can do anything well given time - and could actually save the planet. They just need to find each other and journalists with PhD's and self-made investors who are engineers." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

##### "Video 3 of the Cool School Anti-Masters Class: non-stupid death is your friend; life is a super fun all ages escape room game from stupid death, collapse and entropy. It's called Postworkcraft of the Postworkverse!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

Non-stupid death, collapse and entropy are fine, but stupid death, collapse and entropy is not!















The art simply just proves itself through more complex function, novelty and a playful tone to shoot down claims of elitism, and also to subvert the overbearing obsessiveness of artists with lesser range. 

Also - right now art is 95% low-skilled art with no budget and low-skilled art with high budget - which is obviously the greater evil!

"Humanities & Sciences, media and education can produce visibility for a greylist for corrective actions at planetary, regional and individual scale; hackathon to gather and incentivize the skilled to execute." Captain Amasia, 2023














##### "Mediators make media + hackathon with skilled = save the planet" Captain Amasia, 2023

Just separate the tasks - mediators make media, skilled make solutions!
















****

**"What if we had all the artists and things who couldn't save the planet, regions, and psyches, simply just help publicize the artists and solutions that could save the planet, regions and psyches, thus making both part of an art system that actually worked?" Captain Amasia, 2023**

WHAT IF Traumatized artists and things + skilled artists and solutions = ACTUALLY WORKING ART SYSTEM?!

Seriously, we can imagine the traumatized just making traumatized stuff and then lots of people die; we can also imagine solutions being made that nobody hears about and lots of people die. 

Why not just not make the usual w?










##### "Upcoming for the Democraseum Exhibition: an open forum and optional regionalist hackathon, in any media for people to come up with best ideas for solving housing and health, education and jobs, media and culture, with or without non-human collaborators! You could win $10,000 USD worth of art and also become a cult leader of the bestideas.lol cult!" Antinomy, 2023
