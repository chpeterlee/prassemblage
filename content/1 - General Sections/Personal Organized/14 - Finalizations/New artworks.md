##### POV: You're surrounded by zombie formalist bullshit and totally boring, illiterate solipsistic art; a funny video ad shines in the night. IT'S THE DEMOCRASEUM. BY OZAN ATALAN WHO WORE A MOUSE COSTUME WHILE LECTURING ON NEW MATERIALISM AND PETER LEE WHO BET THAT HE CAN SAVE THE PLANET AND REAL LOVE THROUGH A NEW PHILOSOPHICAL LENS AND STATISTICAL MODEL.











#### Why support the Democraseum Exhibition Project? 

1. Turkey has the same problems that 80% of you have - regional scale ecosocial fragility.
2. Turkey has cutting edge intellectuals and artists who can coordinate effectively across cultures. It's not the insanely boring and dead modernist formalism and totally bankrupt and suicidal nihilist identity politics as in the U.S. and Europe - there is a culture of arbitration and dealmaking.
3. Hence, you can escape your incredibly limiting and boring localities whilst still maintaining your idiosyncrasies and work with people who can behave like actual humans.









##### POV: You're super smart, weird and existentially self-aware. Come to Ideapplebees for an ideapple potluck!

Q1q
### Why is the Democraseum Project your best shot at actually transforming your region?

1. 70% of the conception of art in Europe and the U.S. is an individual product attached to identity politics. 70% of non-profit, corporate and institutional workers are unimaginative and totally willing to let everything collapse as long as they can pick up their paycheck and cash it for their extremely boring lives.
2. The few people in Europe and U.S. who are making collective work don't have either adequate intellectual or technical skills to produce accurate critical responses integrating new concepts and technology.
3. By helping grow the Democraseum, you get to work with artists who ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AND DOING to also help you think about your OWN region, versus just flailing in the dark with your usual 80% total grab bag of traumatized, visionless and aimless insanity **who clearly just read random news and hallucinate based on their imbalanced perspectives.**



















##### Ideapplebees Core Question: What if accurately and inclusively separating and defining what individual psyche is, what desirable organizational processes are and the parameters of actual viable systemic change, is more ecologically sustainable 
than simply blindly producing more inaccurate information, ineffective organizations and pointless projects that 
increase dead bodies, waste resources and increase systemic risk?" Captain Amasia, 2023











**Ideapplebees Structure**

1st we split between people who want to join the "Reinventing the Wheel Authentically" Community and people who want to be in the "Not Reinventing the Wheel Community".

Second, there are infinitely varied dishes of ideapples and other conceptual foods, with infinitely varied utensils. Each dish, utensil and method of cooking or eating is a visualization of both a neural pathway in the diner's brain and a visualization of an inference, which may be accurate or inaccurate. People have varying conceptual allergies and dietary restrictions reflecting the degree of neuroplasticity that they have.

Third, in relation to a given dish, people can self-identify as a chef (Level 3), server (Level 2) or diner (Level 1). 

Fourth, dishes can be rated at scale for an individual diner, a regional scale diner or a planetary scale diner.

Fifth, we can bet on which dishes will be on the right, wrong or hyperdimensional side of history, when raced on a quantum race track.
