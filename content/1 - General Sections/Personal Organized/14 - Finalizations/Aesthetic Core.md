### Upcoming: The Bestideas Artsassin Project: 
 
 Everyone who is either actually 5 years old or momentarily a mental 5 year old, is invited to shoot ðŸ”« Peter with a nerf gun, for free, at any time - but you must write the best ideas on the dart. If it's not actually the best idea, you have to watch one of his insane video artworks that consistently make himself laugh, with or without others, which there are MILLIONS OF HOURS OF (@selman.selma knows this!) ðŸ¤£











## "Under the Skin in the Game of Dreams
**(Hey, My 5 Year Old Kid Could Have Saved the Planet That Way!)" 2023**
*A speculative documentary including pranks in Art Basel*

What if all of the world's ecosocial problems could simply be accurately boiled down to inaccurate risk and incentive models (Skin in the Game) in both art and non-art markets? 

What if decolonial aliens invaded the Earth, aliens whom at minimum had the same degree of polymath data modelling and invention skill that a few polymaths on Earth did, and simply just started correcting market models, with and without permissions from humans? **And they did it by using conceptual art techniques a 5 year old could repeat?**

Art process - Multi-modal-model & Hyperobject Sculpture.

1. As an artwork Peter designed an AI model and hyperobject sculpture.
2. The AI & hyperobject sculpture outputs  problems and solutions, films and artwork to simulate in dream. (Dream has process, memory and modelling capacities - that's enough!)
3. He comes out with solutions to test in real world AI and systems for statistical accuracy. State Space, has many fictional interfaces / critical games, cultural inputs, inferential inputs and biometric data and risk data.

# Cultural Tensors
## Dream LARP / Cult


Murder mystery! Cult



For most, a cult is the answer.
- cult belief first - leftists
- documentary, body first. Half filmed in dream.
- AI detectives and dream documentary

We have a transnational dream:

Neoliberalicide.live is a detective game that people play via half dreams, mimicking the murder method.

- AI can dream
- nonhumans can dream.
- film.
