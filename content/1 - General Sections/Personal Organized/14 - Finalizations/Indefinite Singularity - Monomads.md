"**Speculative Documentary & Steganographic Fiction:  
   **The Indefinite Singularity: The Monomads of the Ethical Futures Institute**
1. Captain Amasia goes to connect and work with the few polymaths in 2023 (who are aliens defined by their ability to do high-level logic, statistics and semiotechnical improvisation) on the planet that can design and build technologies to prevent ecosocial collapse.
2. They may or may not be connecting with decolonial pirate alien shaman avatars from an Ethical Future Institute of 2087, where every 13 year old knows high-level logic, statistics and semiotechnical improvisation to such a degree that as individuals, they can travel alone across the planet and fix all the ecosocial problems of 2023. 
3. Along the way, they fight Zombinaries, Ghostlinearities, Inaccuratepires, The Pedantic Police, and the Neoliberal Suicide Club.
4. The major actions that Captain Amasia and the polymaths perform are:
   - Accurately judging, valuing and healing the problems of 70% postworking class within undereducated neoliberalicidal regions.
   - Wagering against and pressuring uninclusive and unscalable individuals, organizations and systems and promoting inclusively scalable individuals, organizations and systems in the 29.5% regionalist class of modern societies.
   - Connecting polymaths to encrypt paradigm-shifting inventions into fictions to avoid capture from unethical institutions and the neurochemically imbalanced public while maintaining an open channel." Captain Amasia, 2023
