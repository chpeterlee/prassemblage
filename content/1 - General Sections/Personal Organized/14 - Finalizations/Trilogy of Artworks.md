### "Neganthropomorphosis!: Devil Came Down to Amasia (System3.live)" Polyptychs, Captain Amasia, 2023

"**The 0th Wonder : (The Postworkverse Game of Dreams)** 

A superhero game (co-operatively owned), film (speculative documentary), song (worst music, best sound art), AI Model (multi-modal-model) and co-opoly (also using non-violent expropriation)  which is played by both being aware of it and being unaware of it, and inferred data being interpreted towards most inclusive scalability in an open-ended manner" Captain Amasia AND YOU, 2023

"**Under the Skin in the Game: Until We Are Worth More Than Gold (Decolonial Square Trades)**

All the risks and incentive data not priced in which would reduce deaths, sickness and impoverishment from Neoliberalism" Captain Amasia AND YOU, 2023

**"What if art is the open-ended question that others are NOT asking? IsItInclusivelyScalable.art? (IsItNegentropic.com?)" Captain Amasia AND YOU, 2023**

A single question you can use to ask if any given interaction is inclusive and scalable, and thus also construct a concrete argument to transform any situation towards inclusive scalability" Captain Amasia AND YOU, 2023
