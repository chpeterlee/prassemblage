###  "Model"

1. Humanities are too deskilled, transculturally and technologically.
2. Sciences simply solve the thing in front of them. There are very few competent multi-domain engineers and very few skilled and sane Humanities personnel.
3. Culturally it's basically an assembly line. Ask any expert - there is no existing strategic initiative for climate change or dealing with technological impact on inequity. It would take 100 years to solidify scientific consensus; we have 7. Nobody but a few have been working on these problems; if they tried to teach them, it'd take 10 years. Everyone is basically a weird, nerdy 13 year old who is a specialist in logic, or stats, or improvisation, but not all 3, which would be required.
4. Back From the Ethical Futures Institute of 2087, when human population has levelled off at 10 Billion, and there IS a capable infrastructure, peacekeeping and antifragile educational org: Captain Amasia a fictional super hero who solves real world problems using the superpower - an ethical, accurate imagination. Or more technically, Multi-Modal-Model artwork, particularly for socialized ethical, accurate imagination, because we don't have one. Also parallels the use of fiction as simulation space in both military, corporate and legal think tanks.
5. He has some assumptions on art: because the statistical majority of todays infrastructure is broking, the most radical artworks are artworks that are both poetic and also solve problems; he advises 80% simulation, 20% prototyping and emergent implementation over time. 
6. He communicates with decolonial pirate alien shamans who use him like an avatar sometimes to execute artworks and direct actions that don't even make sense to him in the present - a common experience for intellectuals, inventors and shamans and also lifeforms throughout human and evolutionary history.
7. He identifies as an Amasian Shaman of the Star peoples. He establishes a link with them through imagination, and encrypting and decrypting the adjacent possible using the Autodidactic University Protocol.
8. Mission is to bring peace amongst the universe, through growing imaginations and sorting through adjacent possibilities. Captain Amasia has used Chongha Peter Lee to start the ismodernism church to aid in their mission.
9. Due to the statistical nature, and limits of computation, it is a defensive strategy. 
10. They are trying to limit the possibility of vacuum decay, which could be triggered by superluminal means.
