It is not reciprocal exchange; those who really love give freely, with a goal.

This goal is not to gain influence or manipulate the perception of the receiver of the gift; this goal is to simply free the other from an unnecessary burden, or offer an option that is not mandatory.

This love is not from the lover; it is from love-in-itself, acting through the lover, who ultimately, will never be more than a humble servant.

The attraction that draws others to the lover is simply a deeper underlying probabilistic storm assembling itself over time."  Your lover and humble servant to love-in-itself, Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

This shouldn't be too hard to make, I don't know why it hasn't been made yet!











Dear internet - could you imagine if we simply had a filter on every part of you that allowed us to quickly sort the least stupid to the top?

## Why don't we just have 2 internets: 1 for daily trivialities, 1 for actual thought?

I don't mind being poor, I do mind being subjected to stupid conversations - and of the two, I very much prefer the former.

# "Hack the Wack Challenge: open call to hack and tank the 100 worst artists of any genre" President Estamasia, 2023







Media can be used to pressure corporate landlords and businesses.

Anything that needs to actually be changed can just be hacked.

Only thing to make is cults, parties and pranks.











----

We don't have the type of artists and people that can do:
- Conceptual art
- Activism
- Research






The only thing that will work:
- Cults
- Parties
- Pranks














----

- sell to press.
- package together multiples.
- get points.



Good artists are not good administrators; nor is the reverse true.





















### "Non-conceptual artists don't age gracefully." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

Unfortunately, the real payoff for intelligence, is a real life. 

If you don't learn how to think, life is basically a dark, pointless stumble to death, sooner most likely than later.

Lord, do I miss running around breaking stuff. If the world wasn't so messed up I'd basically just be a planetary pirate.

# "Decision Zero (a poem)

Kill neoliberalism accurately or die
Contract accurately or die
Model accurately or die"

Chongha Peter Lee, 2023















POV: You wake up in the post neoliberalpocalypse. You realize only a few skilled polymaths and contractors can save the planet. In the meantime what do you do?

1. Fight zombinaries, Ghostlinearities and inaccuratepires.
2. Build model regionalist co-opolies.
3. Make bet






How to cut through the noise:

Polymaths
Child performers
PhD educated journalists

Everyone else needs therapy!

"99.5% of people need:

stories and enemies." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023















There's 3 levels of solutions today:

1. L1 Individual transregionalism and physical presence socioeconomy (70% of people)
2. L2 Regional transorganizing and service socioeconomy (29.5%)
3. L3 Planetary transmediation and model socioeconomy (.5%)

 The 0th Wonder (or Rule Zero): a game, film and quantum virus played by being aware or unaware of it, and people just build a game and film simulation, which has an AI version of them which has polymath skills and and these versions just fix the real world, by making a game interface to it which they can then pass back through and rewire its infrastructure, with or without their awareness." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023








## "Ideapplebees Right Side of History Jeopardy Bet by Peter (Contract, Hack, Automate or Die):

3 most likely pathways to systemic ecosocial solutions:

1. Contract contractors with advanced capacity
2. Hack infrastructure
3. Automated arbitration

Culture just needs shrooms and video art, not education. The adults and specialists we have are too far gone to build anything, unless you have other people there walking them step by step. " Chongha Peter Lee, 2023












## "Ideapplebees Right Side of History Jeopardy Bet by Peter (Contract or Die):

I bet that even if the unthinkable happened and tomorrow we woke up and the world had passed laws perfectly regulating and taxing all corporations and left everything in the ground, we would still need to **research and develop**:

1. Technology and culture for utilizing actually inclusive and scalable alternative energy sources.
2. Technology and culture for monitoring, coordinating and incentivizing eco-regulation. 

Neither civilian institutions nor grass roots have this knowledge and skill. It would take them at least 40 years to even think it.

The ONLY viable path is funding from private investors or military funding of highly skilled contractors with the capabilities." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023
