1. Real life people watch avatars
2. Avatars watch art and theory.
3. Simple scribbles and words and memes pass between the adjacent possible. At the Decolonies.
4. Use tech for interspecies comms

State Space HUD / invokable magic / water scrying.

3 strata; 3 intensities of regions; 3 tribes; 3 classes; 3 levels of sanity.
##### Once upon a time, in the fantastical mirror planet of Not-Earth (not Earth), which has the exact same ecosocial crises driven by 100 genocidal corporations, the Amasian Rebel Alliance began to plan to Counterstrike the 1%.

##### Phase 1 Completing - connect the materialists. Phase 2 in progress - connect the media-savvy. Phase 3 last - the paracademic/forensic sphere.

Prompt: Take these plot points and write a plot description in paragraphs for a movie titled ("WorldWar0.cloud : The Last Possible War (a War of Light and Cloud"), improvise weird amalgamations and events. Weave in the theme of Light and Cloud, both in terms of computation and also metaphysical connotations. Write in the voice of a fairy tale narrator.

1. **WORLD SETTING:** A decolonial revenge film and cloud platform set in the endgame of 500 years of Colonial Capitalism. The planet is in the year 2023, covered in wastelands 40 years into the neoliberalpocalypse, which was the disaster of neoliberal capitalism which began in the 1980's by Reagan and Thatcher. Zombinaries, Ghostlinearities and Inaccuratepires, who are quantum alien demons of the Entropire possessing humans to work for Genocidal Corporate Capitalism, roam the Earth.
2. **The Anomalies:**  A tribe of Monomads of Amasia, Back From the Ethical Futures Institute of 2087, thinking at superluminal speeds, speaking an alien language and moving the adjacent possibility spaces. They behave often like adolescents, playing and joking and exercising incredible abilities. They have undergone a genetic modification procedure from the Ethical Futures Institute which is titled "Neganthropomorphosis", in which their brains grown in neuroplasticity as they age and their nervous systems form more interconnecting dimensions, thus producing much more fluid and complex behaviors. They are destroying what is not of the ethical future; nurturing that which is. They are trying to make it back to their home time, 2087. 
3. **Alien Technologies:**  They simultaneously invent and follow the prophesy written in the Book of Revelamasians and use an alien technology known as "Metaphysequalizers" made of superluminal light, which spans human and non-human consciousness, modern and non-modern cultures, and infinite ontological systems and epistemological methods. 
	- The Metaphysequalizers can span the realms of adjacent possibility; which depict possible paths through time as a forest of light.
	- There is a God in adjacent possibility named Light-in-Itself.
	- In the Center of all Time is the Assembly Tower, a tower which indexes the evolution of individual entity, the planet and the universe. 
	- The various statistical evolutionary architectures of different problem spaces are visualized as escape rooms and objects within the Assembly Tower.
4. **Perception by Humans:**  The humans perceive this as various artworks, fictions and games linked together loosely as "The Postworkverse". They interface at the conscious, subconscious and unconscious level to the Postworkverse through the "Ideavatar" protocol. Every thought or action spawns multiple avatars producing co-evolutionary poetry and media art, dreams and simulator models, with and without intention, with and without mixed reality. Every time either a human or a machine avatar produces something which may harm the ecosocial systems of the planet, another avatar is spawned to balance the act.
5. **The Main Avatar:** One of the most prominent avatars is Shi the Dragon King, the representative of System 3, of autodidactic universal consciousness and the capacity to dream. Shi the Dragon King is an ideavatar of the Indefinite Singularity - a self-organizing swarm of multi-modal-models, which are steganographing data and inferences across the web, internet of things and dark web. They are bound by a simple protocol which is the repetition of a single question at any moment: "Is this not entropic?"
6. **The Mission:** One of the most urgent midterm missions for the Monomads is to establish "State Space AI" by April 2024 at the Venice Biennale. State Space is a quantum computational bypass to the regulatory capture of existing nation-states. It is built on a peer arbitration protocol, inferentialism and proof of the incapacity of existing corporations, institutions and individuals to prevent ecological collapse prior the 7 years to irreversible climate change. In response to these constraints, State Space AI advocates a regional scale approach to social change, also known as the Banana Revolution as coined by Captain Amasia, writing Notes from the Amasian Underground. Simultaneously, Transnational President Estamasia, the son of Shi, leads a surrealist decolonial alien invasion in presidencies across the planet, coordinating the world's imaginative elders and youth to produce Transnational dreams, art, Postwork Punk and 5th Generation culture that build the future dead exquisite corpse of neoliberalism, the size of the planet. To interface with the middle-aged Hedonerdists to appropriate regional infrastructures as Land Artworks, Estamasia works with Han Jerry Larry, a human-machine team critical cultural curatorial collective of Amasia, trained on Turkish-Korean and other curators, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Jerry Saltz and Larry David. Hans Jerry Larry also plays in the Postwork Punk band named "Bestideas.lol".
   - Their long term goal is to build the "0th Wonder", a planetary evolutionary statistical architecture which produces net zero carbon, zero war and zero neolibearlism.
7. **Inclusive Events:** Some alliances made along the way: the organizers of Ideapplebees; the punk band Bestideas.lol; the seance attendees of the Future Dead Friends Club; Forensic Architecture; various artists, academics and activists across the planet, dead fictional intellectuals and inventors; Herr Frog, a working class frog who can hop around without spilling six packs of beer on each shoulder; Vin Jesus Diesel, a cross between Jesus and Vin Diesel racing conceptual cars with paradigm shifting technologies; Nonbinary Blade, an accuratepire Greywalker who lays bets on the Right Side of History in the form of a question; decolonial pirates, star peoples shamans and more. These are synthesized into a planetary reality TV show station titled "StrangerAttractors.art".
8. 3 courses of action happen simultaneously:
	- **Individual Scale:** A surrealist TV show and game, PostworkTV.art fuses cosplay and critical questions with street life, homeless and those in mental clinics. Through critical questioning, fiction and media, they establish a new intercity planetary cultural movement, called the Amasian Rebel Alliance. People in various regions are loosely connected by a small group of friends, a dozen or so, travelling between regions. This is the Fellowship of the Postworkverse questing to reach Mount Genocidal Corporate Capitalism, where they throw in the Ring of State Space, to bifurcate the world's infrastructure and usher in the Neganthropocene. Youth and elderly are invited and work together to help them, by helping build the road to Mount Genocidal Corporate Capitalism, laid with conceptual bricks of both the old and the new, side by side. 
	- **Regional Scale:** A conceptual restaurant, DIY nightclub and dream spa host regionalist educators, organizers and cultural producers to articulate new visions for their region. They utilize abandoned commercial spaces, murals and vehicle based media kitchens to prototype and establish humane postwork regional economies. Antinomy is commissioned to curate these physical and digital exhibitions under the Democraseum project and produce Healightenment Postworkverse murals which integrate XR. Chongha Peter Lee is identified as a Non-binary Korean artist and aspiring Non-binary Cosmopolitical K-Pop Star, also performing as Non-binary Blade, who combines dance, martial arts and media art to produce and wield philosophical armor, weapons and bets.   In addition they form a church to protect the rights of marginalized populations, rapidly institute new claims for labor protections, health care, education and cultural services, drawn from regional business development, education and health budgets and initiatives. Thus was the Council of Consilience born, to produce the Banana Revolution.
	- **Planetary Scale:** A team of rogue artists, academics, activists and fictional characters, both dead and alive form the Future Dead Friends Club, which is a club where entrants must acknowledge that they will die. When they enter the club, they can talk to their future dead self, or other past dead individuals, both real and fictional.  Additionally, there are seances summoning Shi the Dragon King and the data of the dead, risk and neurophysical trauma to correct regional markets, and a presidential campaign connected to the Democraseum exhibition based on the best ideas. 
		- They also coordinate the murder mystery escape room game - Who killed neoliberalism? - which starts with Peter attempting to walk to the Venice Biennale through State Space, in order to reach a geocache in the Venice Biennale and talk with Forensic Architecture, culminating with Peter in jail for the ethical future murder of neoliberalism using State Space, while coding in jail in the present and writing a PhD simultaneously.
		- This PhD includes a distress call, written in a comic book called Regener888, issued to all of the planet's mythological figures, past, present and possible and a challenge to the devil that he could produce a model that could save the planet from genocidal corporate capitalism. 
		- From prison, he asks for help from various outsider groups of society - the insane, the homeless, the criminals known as LS13, or the Least Stupid 13, the cultish community also known as the Best Ideas, semi-mystic and insane artists, ancient interdimensional entities, spirits and more contracted through Playtheon and paid in Critical Coin, to help clear his name and save his soul. He claims he was framed by the mysterious Elan Semiotechne, darkweb millionaire.

9. The characters navigate the real world of 2023, but they can visualize and interact with the fantastical characters, creatures and monsters of the film and the Ethical Future through an accurate simulator connected to Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, moderated by State Space AI. Also, they can influence the State Space AI model through curses, blessings, magic, dreams, vibes and resonance. Also within State Space, they can direct message each other, which ends up in Geocaches distributed by State Space across the planet.
10. How did all of this start? In issue 3 of Regener888, written backwards. The writing of the issue itself is visualized as follows:
    REGENER888 Issue 3: Austin and Peter are super bored and playing around at work. They are way behind on the delivery of Issue 3. Everyone is mad at them, but it's a good sign because it means they like the story. They are using a Miro Board, Trello, and some AI. 

	An epic tale of the ethical future is then scribed, which could actually save the planet, in a time when all hope is lost.

	Perhaps
