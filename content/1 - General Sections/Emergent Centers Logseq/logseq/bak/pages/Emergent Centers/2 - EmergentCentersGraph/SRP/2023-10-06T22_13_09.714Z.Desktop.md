- The SRP stands for "[[Statistical Review Protocol]]" which is a protocol utilized by the [[Open Source Universal Basic Intelligence Communities]] in which agents execute a protocol of statistically inferencing net negentropic system states which can withstand peer review from both human and non-human agents.
- There are 3 major verification processes of the [[SRP]] used to triangulate verification of strong [[inference]]s:
	- Physical evidence.
	- Simulations of philostatistical models.
	- AI-aided search and strong [[inference]] of existing datasets.
- Inferences can be qualified through [[Inferential Distance]] and likelihood.
- Inferences can be grouped into [[1 - General Sections/Personal Organized/16 - Notebook Scraps/Tasks]], [[function]], [[system state]], which can comprise a [[model]].
