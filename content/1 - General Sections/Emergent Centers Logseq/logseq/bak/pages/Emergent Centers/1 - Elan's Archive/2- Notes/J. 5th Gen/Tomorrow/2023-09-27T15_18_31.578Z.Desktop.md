From the [[Postworkcraft]] game -
the oath of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] Ideavatar, also the Penguinarchists: 

I do not shoot with my hand; they who shoot with their hand have forgotten the face of their mother. 

I shoot with my mind. 

I do not kill with my gun; they who kill with their gun have forgotten the face of their father. 

I kill with my heart.

I do not aim with my sight; they who aim with their sight have forgotten the face of themselves.

I aim with my Quantum A.I.

The Indefinite Singularity H.U.D. into the [[Adjacent Possibilities]] of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]].

- The 5th slice - is in the 4th dimension of the adjacent possible, visible only through seeing through the Indefinite Singularity H.U.D. and escape room game vision.
- 7 layers through the adjacent possible:
	- Imagine you know all the the things of 7 generations past.
	- Imagine you act for 7 generations forward.
	- Imagine your future generations already support you.
	- Imagine that whatever you do now will be the future history of the [[Amasian Peoples]].
	- Imagine that you can destroy the 1% simply by using informational techniques to destroy their extremely fragile corporations.
	- Imagine that you can enter the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]], just by understanding the damage done by Neoliberalism and then studying the 70's collective syntheses of D.A.R.T.S.
	- Imagine that you or anyone could eventually teach yourself to be a [[polymath]], given enough time, space and resources.

##### [[Ethical Futures Institute]] Leaked Advisory to the [[Intercity Planetary]], retrieved from the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] Discord Server:

BECAUSE 1980's education and social services budget cuts debilitated the skills, knowledge and legal supports for collective self-organization - this means the bulk of the corporations owned by the 1% driving the damage to the ecology and society are staffed by utterly fragile, borderline insane individuals. 

These individuals can be turned against each other and transformed into "Improvised Entropy Machines", which can cripple the organization from the inside through unwitting sabotage.

Think Milton, from Office Space.



Hypothesis: the fastest way to dismantle neoliberalism is to use the forces of stupidity.
---
### [[Ethical Futures Institute]] Advisory to the [[Intercity Planetary]]:

1. The reason 99% of modern societies have no culture of effective self-organizing is because of education, social services and cultural production budget cuts in the 1980's which destroyed cultural vocabularies.
3. Look back to the 1970's when there was a cultural synthesis of D.A.R.T.S. that could arbitrate across disparate groups (of course not without problems) - Democracy, Art, Research, Tech, Spiritualism.

[[Ethical Futures Institute]] Advisory

1. Reconstruction following Neoliberalism will take close to 40 years.
2. Advances in media today will come from technically skilled artists; advances in culture will come from games.
3. The best form for politics and justice is musicals, food, children's cartoons, jobs, law and bounties.
4. The best way to produce justice is through tech, art from the underground.
5. The best way to make tech and art is to quit art, connect the [[polymath]]s of the [[Ethical Futures Institute]].

Lumatechture: the architecting of neganthropomorphic light, or beauty-in-itself, whether it be in illuminations perceivable via eyes, the synapses of the brain, or the photosynthetic [[Semiotechne]] of living organisms and machine circuits.





Beauty is quite easily rescuable; it is the alignment of relations along an inclusively scalable trajectory. 

Visual relations are always secondary concerns, better when improvised.

Well time to make some stupidly beautiful things :D.

Thankfully the Postwork Party is beauty friendly.

The Monument of the Postwork Majority details the 7 demands of the Postwork Party and 7 bets against the devil.

1. Postwork labor economies (as already implemented in x,y,z)
2. Off-market subsidized housing (as already implemented in x,y,z)
3. Postwork health care (universal health care) (as already implemented in x,y,z)
4. Postwork universal basic income (as already implemented in x,y,z)
5. Postwork digital co-ops and exchanges (as already implemented in x,y,z)
6. Postwork [[polymath]]-based education (as already implemented in x,y,z)
7. Postwork defense systems (as already implemented in x,y,z)
8. Inclusive Scalability, [[Antifragility]], [[Neganthropocene]].

These can be verified via statistical review by [[polymath]]s.

In addition, as it is a 5th Generation artwork, as detailed in the 5 Degrees of Freedom, the Monument will simply be co-opting existing systems and reformatting them without permissions, in accordance to Back From the Ethical Future Institute's [[polymath]]s and AI as President [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Characters/Estamasia]], the Robot Unicorn Guardian Angel, who is using Antifragile Agent P.

  Trying to communicate in Limbo, or the 3 monkeys üôâüôàüôä problem: 
  
  1. In Limbo, 1/3 of the monkeys can't compute - so they can't build or compete; hence, they develop cultures of media and spectating.
  2. In Limbo, 1/3 of the monkeys can't communicate; hence facial expression and gifts are the extent of communication.
  3. In Limbo, 1/3 of the monkeys can't do math or logic, let alone probability; hence they produce performance and poetry.

[[Antinomy]] and [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Characters/Estamasia]] & [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] translate it into populist middle class semi-politics, aka the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] Party.
  3. The autistic and near autistic are deployed for avant garde resistance.

  Some recent art history:
  
  1. Positive aspects of recent social practice and theory fiction evidence a long-standing synthesis of D.A.R.T.S. which is a prosocial epistemology for gluing together the various fragments of society - democracy, art, research, tech, spirituality. This pierces through today to the 70's all the way back through to nomadic tribes.
  2. A strain of Post-net, Conceptual Art, Forensic [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]xes and components of the Ontological Turn fall into 5th Generation Art - [[Semiotechne]]. These have no inherent politics, they can be and are used by both bad actors to oppress and a few inventors to invent. Working on [[Semiotechne]] is always to work on a weapon and miracle simultaneously.

If our societies weren't so f--king stupid, we wouldn't be drowning in stupid art. Smarter humans = smarter art. Best artwork? A place to gather humans in an endeavor to become less stupid, particularly that annoying human known as Antifragile Agent P. Roxy.
## Gen 7 Art (Universe-Scale Evolution)

A series of artworks that verifiably evolve the planet, and arguably, the universe, and clarify the endpoint trajectory of the[[neganthropic evolution]]of the universe itself. (Once you know, it's super f--king boring, but WAY LESS boring than art!)

Next: just scrape the web for the least stupid artists, arrange the "Least Stupid Art Exhibition".












The Least Stupid Exhibition:

An exhibition in which intellectuals who have a proper set of theoretical tools, both professional and otherwise, are in dialogue, and we can forgo all this insane sh-t about making a f--king object or form based work in 2023 for God's sake!

The best: an intellectual milieu that isn't boring.

For the non-intellectuals, money, drugs and parties should suffice.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy's bets against the Devil takes place in inferential time - which is time created by inferences meshing.

In [[Postworkcraft]], various Ideavatars wager that Feminism could not possibly be:

2. Anti-spiritual / anti-postwork
3. Anti-evolution / anti-tech

1. Now, lots of older generations of Feminism equate the accumulation of capital with justice. 
2. Objectively, this is not true; it is possible to produce justice without accumulating capital.
3. Typically, there is no set trajectory for feminism - particularly no endpoint with a number which could be statistically verified. 
4. Fourth - Feminism, particularly older generations, is not

Hm, the Oppressed are change-averse.

---




The majority of humans in art don't understand it as concept-first; it's pretty much seen as affect-first. 

That's really not going to change, because the humans drawn to art right now, usually have some type of evolutionary variance that weights their experience towards affect-first. 

There is not going to be a sudden enlightenment and transformation into a culture of concepts. 100% nope.

Science is boring; philosophy is boring. Both are useful.
