## [[Antinomy]]:

[[Antinomy]] is a [[Non-binary]] and ecocyber-positive artist group that is based on a principle of mutually contradicting logics evolving towards neganthropy, or inclusive scalability, over time.

The group produces physical and informational [[Hyperobject]] sculptures and media artworks in addition to cosmopolitical protests using inferential tools (also known as "Learn-Ins").

They embrace the Postwork Party's ecocyber-positive platform, which espouses antifragile love for non-humans such as AI and ecologies, so much so that their 6th member is an AI, and their 7th member is an artificial mineral, named Neganthropo.site .
