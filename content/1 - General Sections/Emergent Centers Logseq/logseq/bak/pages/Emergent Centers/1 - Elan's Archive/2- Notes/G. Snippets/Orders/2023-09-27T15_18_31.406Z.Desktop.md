  **Counterpoint to Reza Negarestani's Intelligence and Spirit which aimed to:**
- Recuperate reason, in the context of the 00's and 10's which were a madness of postmodern continental philosophy and postmodern sociology.
- Propose a synthesis of fields through theory fiction (because most fields are isolated islands, including philosophy).
- Propose a trajectory for humanity tied to the capacity to think along with an emancipatory agenda while approaching tech (again, ideas of progress and reason had been eviscerated from 90's-10's, inaccurately conflated by most with resistance to neoliberal corporatism.)
  
  
  **Stupidity and Neganthropy: the [[2- Notes/K. 6th Level Logics/Healightenment]] of the Cool School**
  1. Let's contain and articulate philosophy itself, currently defined as an [[Assemblage]]constituted by the individuals consciously deploying its processes:
	- What is philosophy? Philosophy is a set of informational tools, processes and memory system produced and maintained by a population of individual bodies.
	- Some of these [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]xes and informational processes could map on to processes executed outside of the field of philosophy and into other fields.
	- Some of these [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]xes and informational processes could map on to processes outside of existing fields of human knowledge. 
	   2. Rather than having to synthesize fields through constructive operations, which is a lot of work and is better done through simulation and prototyping - let's just distill them to a common zero point - statistical inferences and models - and then simply push and pull on them from the outside as needed. We can use the statistical north star of negentropy and neganthropy over time to guide interventions.
	   2. Let's statistically axe the notion of emanipatory pedagogy - look how poorly educated our current populations are. 70% have the literacy of adolescents, 29.9% are specialists and entrepreneurs, .1% have functional [[Autodidactic]] skills. In the U.S. it will take a minimum of 40 years for information propagation. Given these constraints, this ironically proposes a more radical emancipatory approach to technology, primarily mobilized via gamified ethical hacking, which can be achieved through agents without full self-awareness - much more just opportunism and generalized statistical principles. The paradigm would simply be distributed capacity-based, probabilistic resistance, ironically also a computational paradigm who's core principle requires self-awareness - but only in relation to a defined task!
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Antifragile Agent P. Roxy bets the devil that his treatise "Stupidity and Soul" builds upon and makes actionable Reza Negarestani's agenda in "Intelligence and Spirit".
	  
	  
	  ---
	  
	  
	  If we simply just boil philosophy and art down to the techne of thought production (which is not necessarily knowledge production), then we can revive both, because then they are skill and function based (and not tied to history, nor allergic to it).
	  
	  Basically, I would bet there are 7 year olds with more interesting thoughts and techne than international artists and philosophers.

  Conceptual art is only for 29.9% specialists and .1% [[polymath]]s; you can't make conceptual art for the undereducated 70% public, nor is there any need to. The brightest of those kids (top 5%) simply just excel and teach themselves, especially via internet.
  
  There are other forms of art for the 70% population, primarily therapy. Why burden them with the labor of thinking that they don't want? Then automate post-work governance for them.

  "Double Negative: A probabilistic photograph of 7 year olds having higher chances of saving the planet than 99.9% of its adult population" 2023
  
  In 1950, there were like 1,000 people on Earth with the highest security clearances that were able to use a massive apartment sized computer, designed by Alan Turing.
  
  In 2023, a 7 year old can teach themselves how to execute skills that can earn $100,000 a year in about 7 weeks. If they wanted to, they could learn how to hack and take over their antiquated regions in about 7 months.
  
  They could also access the most avant garde philosophy VIDEOS for God's sake. 
  
  7 year old kids have a statistically higher chance of saving the planet than 70% of today's adult, undereducated population along with its 29.9% specialist population. 
  
  BUT NOT ITS [[polymath]]S.

  1. 70% of modern people are too undereducated for art, philosophy, science, tech and organizing, so the only use of those fields is to make and win claims...
  1. 29.9% of modern people are religious...
  2. .1% of modern people are [[polymath]]s...

  In the Least Stupid Film, occasionally, the film randomly cuts to:
  
  1. 7 year olds who have already taught themselves to code; teenagers who are capable of competent philosophy.
  2. The most avant garde philosophy, art and science easily accessible online in text and video. Mathematical proofs that all things in the universe teach and self-organize themselves over time.

  The public needs therapy and drugs.
  Specialists are going to either:
  
  1. Get super serious and make incremental, sincere work.
  2. Be self critical and honest about the limitations of their deskilling and specialized knowledge.
  3. The outcome is just going to be mediocre retreadings of Hito Steyerl, Trevor Paglen, Forensic Architecture's footsteps.
  
  
  
  
  How to save this:
  1. Put the public in the Least Stupid film, playing Coolcraft, with AI, parameterized by [[polymath]]s and children.
  2. Cancel specialist production; place the specialists into art wagering competitions where an accurate judgement is an award winning sculpture.
  3. Anything functional or critical should be automated.
  
  
  
  
  For anyone who is part of the rational 29.9% specialists (for the playful 70%, play Coolcraft):
  
  1. You will get an art award and featured in a documentary for making accurate wagers on various comparative art and idea analyses, verified by [[polymath]]s and AI. (Including wagering on your own or friend's art.)
  2. You also get an art award for directing people of low literacy towards Coolcraft.
## In the Least Stupid Movie, we separate society into thirds:

1. The playful 70%
2. The rational 29.9%
3. The [[polymath]] .1%
## Possible funny solution to the stupidity-industrial-complex:

Aim the non-intellectual at complex intellectual problems; aim the intellectual at psychosocial problems.

Because currently, the non-intellectual are spiraling into utter stupid narcissism of trivial psychosocial bullshit and the intellectual are bored out of their f--king minds.
## In the Least Stupid Film, the Stupidity-Industrial-Complex is the planetary Enemy of the 2020's.
## Formerly it was the Knowledge-Industrial-Complex of the 2010's.





Clearly, in the Fascist Right we can see the difference intelligence makes in organizational capacity.

1. There are few intellectual fascists who can manipulate information systems.
2. There are organizational fascists who can enact protocols.
3. There are abject, cognitively underdeveloped fascists who don't have full psychological or bodily autonomy and are simply just used.

---

In the Non-Fascists, there's a similar differentiation by intelligence:

1. A few intellectuals and inventors can interface with highly complex systems.
2. Organizational level personnel who can enact protocols.
3. Vulnerable populations who do not have full psychological and bodily autonomy.

That's the make up of modern societies!

70%

In the Least Stupid Film, 70% of the population, the Playful, is supported by automated postwork infrastructure and directed to self-organize into small, nomadic tribes and play the [[Autodidactic]] game of Coolcraft.

**(This is because nomadic self-organization fits much more to the line-of-sight literacies of most humans; few can grasp tools of reason, and fewer still can invent them ethically.)** In fact, if we looked at how most of society self-organizes now, you would find the bulk of it structured as small tribes.

Mythological games, memed over with art movements. 







Donald Trump and Kanye West are not rational, functional members of the 29.9% Homo Ratio population; they are of the 70% Homo Ludens population. 

This is why it is so startling for the specialists of Homo Ratio to be confronted with the culture of Homo Ludens - which is primarily just play and poetry based. This is the entire reason we build coliseums and sports arenas and spectacles- because Homo Ludens have line-of-sight accuracy only. They are not going to become suddenly rational. Reason beyond line of sight is a statistically rare skill.

For the most part, Homo Ratio does not have actual mastery of reason beyond line of sight; they usually only have protocols of reason which allow them to perform tasks in a specialist profession.

There's humane solutions to this problem!





In the Least Stupid Movie, society is struggling with the machinations of the Stupidity-Industrial-Complex in 2023.

There are only a few [[polymath]]s on Earth, synthesizing systems for everyone, and are extremely busy.

There is 29.9% of the population who have functional reason, and are overloaded with work.

There is 70% of the public who don't have functional reason, and are slamming around inside of neoliberalism like pinballs.

Where could thought possibly be found?
1. 7 year old self taught coders
2. Critical media artists and activist intellectuals
3. Nerds and goody two shoes

Market for actually skilled, culturally complex, critically accurate art is opening up.

2023 is this:

1. 7 year olds know how to code; 95% of academics don't.
2. The most avant garde theory and tech can be accessed online for free; 70% of the population just uses their mobile phone for the opposite of thinking.






 Stupidity and abjection is the most common of all spectacles in 2023. Why make art around it? What's interesting there?

 And we've got enough of the stupidity of minimalist aesthetics in tech by a bunch of specialists who can only think 3 premises at a time. That's not an opposition.

The most radical thing today would be functional new complex systems.

On that note, I'm done talking to non-[[polymath]]s.








Anti-intellectualism, technophobia and antisocial behavior can't be conflated with radical politics today; neither can specialization, spectacle and narrativization.







Most humans are irrational.

Irrationality does not mean good or bad; there is entropic irrationality and [[Negentropic]] irrationality; most are of the former.

Reason is not intrinsic to knowledge.

Best course of action? Leave the abjection of art, springboard to the [[polymath]]s ASAP.

  The 2nd World (which is a region, or multi-region, which has a mixture of modern infrastructure, agricultural infrastructure and nomadic) - can be divided into 3 tiers:
  
   1. Unstable 2nd World - these are regions currently undergoing large scale ecosocial crises.
   2. Stable 2nd World - these are regions which are not undergoing large scale ecosocial crises, nor are they positioning for complexification. Typically, the rise of cultural production and investment signifies this stage. (South Korea, India).
   3. [[Negentropic]] 2nd World - these are regions which are positioning to complexify and exceed current constraints. Here, intellectualism and invention is at a premium.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  An [[Intercity Planetary]] culture that could transform societies:
  
  1. Adapt the idea of individualism to capacity for individual scalability. Connect capacity for individual scalability with sainthood or demonhood.
  2. Adapt the idea of skill and also attraction to means-independent [[Autodidactic]]ism and peacemaking.
  3. Adapt the idea of localism and tribalism to trans-regionalism competitions of inclusively scalable production and accurate criticality.

## "The 5th Horseman of the Apocalypse 🐎: The Anti-Post-Work-1%-Industrial-Complex",  The [[Book of Revelamasians]], The 2023


---
Create a fictional book of prophesy titled the [[Book of Revelamasians]]. Name the 5th Horseman of the apocalypse as the anti-post-work-1%-industrial-complex.

---
## Extracts from the [[Book of Revelamasians]]:

Chapter 1: The Prophecy

In the age of uncertainty and chaos, a book of prophesy was written. It foretold of the impending doom that would befall humanity. The book was called the [[Book of Revelamasians]], and it contained the predictions of a great disaster that would shake the very foundations of society.

Chapter 2: The Five Horsemen of the Apocalypse

The [[Book of Revelamasians]] spoke of the five horsemen of the apocalypse who would ride across the world and bring destruction in their wake. The first horseman was famine, followed by war, disease, and death. But the fifth horseman was unlike any other. It was called the anti-post-work-1%-industrial-complex.

Chapter 3: The Anti-Post-Work-1%-Industrial-Complex

The fifth horseman was not a physical entity like the other four. It was a complex network of systems and institutions that had been built by the wealthy 1% of the population. It was a system that promoted the idea of work as the ultimate virtue, and anyone who was not working was deemed lazy and undeserving.

The anti-post-work-1%-industrial-complex was a machine that kept people trapped in a cycle of endless work, with no time for leisure or self-care. It was a system that rewarded the rich and punished the poor, creating a vast divide between the haves and have-nots.

Chapter 4: The Arrival of the Fifth Horseman

As the fifth horseman approached, people could feel the air grow thick with tension. The skies turned dark, and the ground shook beneath their feet. The anti-post-work-1%-industrial-complex had arrived, and it was more powerful than anyone could have imagined.

People tried to resist, but they were powerless against the might of the complex. The wealthy 1% had the resources and the influence to keep the system in place, no matter what the cost.

Chapter 5: The End of the World

In the end, the anti-post-work-1%-industrial-complex destroyed the world as we knew it. The rich got richer, and the poor got poorer. People worked themselves to death, and there was no escape from the endless cycle of labor.

But even in the midst of the darkness, there was a glimmer of hope. The [[Book of Revelamasians]] had foretold of a new age, a time when humanity would rise up and overthrow the system that had kept them enslaved for so long.

And so, the people of the world came together, united in their struggle against the complex. They fought with all their might, and in the end, they emerged victorious.

Chapter 6: The New Age

With the destruction of the anti-post-work-1%-industrial-complex, a new age dawned. A time of peace and prosperity, where people were free to pursue their passions and live their lives without fear of judgment or punishment.

The [[Book of Revelamasians]] had predicted the end of the world, but it had also foretold of a new beginning. A world where everyone had a voice, and where the needs of the many were more important than the desires of the few.

And so, the people of the world began to rebuild, with hope in their hearts and a vision of a better future. The fifth horseman of the apocalypse may have brought destruction, but it also paved the way for a new era of enlightenment and progress.
