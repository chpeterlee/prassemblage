In the [[Non-binary Korean]] horror movie, the Fragility, people split into 2 populations:

1. Non-[[polymath]] adults and children: they take a bunch of shrooms, dmt, weed and make a horror movie and art about their fragilities and all of the world's systems that only Alan Turing like [[polymath]]s could possibly fix. [[polymath]] adults and children: they set bounties for ethical hacking to save the planet, correct every single existing market and pay people for producing antifragile democracies.

- 3. Split into monstrous tribes.
- all open via rap call
- Attends wedding.
- Makes deals with the Tribes. 
  4. [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] is the Quantum AI best self bff of everyone on the planet, and is an exact minimal depiction of the antifragilities every citizen should be capable of in order to keep the planet from collapsing in 10 years and storing 12,000 children from dying of preventable poverty per day. Exorcism. Rebalances towards negentropy. Gets beat up by feminists, spits out philostatistical accuracies.

  5. The movie is shot by [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/1 - Elan's Archive/1 - Documents/B. Middle Frames/10. Nitty Gritty/Shi the Dragon King]] , using the [[Turbojustice]] Quantum AI algorithms.
  6. The movie is part of [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Bestideas.lol]], shown at [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Ideapplebees]].
  7. A.r.T., a.r.t., art. Sold on the fair share fair.
  8. Why not an Accurate deal?
  9. [[Democraseum]], Amasiacoin ,INF. Ose. Hack, question, withdraw.
## 3 types of artists:
- Think outside a small box
- Think outside a large box
- Think and invent a new verifiable geometrical system and manufacturing pipeline that can solve the planet's ecosocial crises.

  [[Until We Are Worth More Than Gold (Main)]] sub-plot:
  
  Less than a hundred millenials scattered across the planet, who had survived the heaviest bombardments of World War Fragility from 2016 emergency quantum bioinferential CRISPR injected superpositional serums, which induced several adjacent possible mutations.
  
  They have coalesced into a functional [[Intercity Planetary]] distributed network, in and out of institutions, forming the [[[[[[Emergent Centers]]]]s]], set to reconvene in the beginning of 2023. 
  
  They form a decolonial heist team to steal back the antifragile superpositional heart of the [[Intercity Planetary]], which had been surgically reshaped in the 15th Century through law, religious doctrine and media warfare.

Triangle of sadness
### 99.9% have audience literacies; not creative literacies. Not good or bad, is what it is.
### The right individual has high odds to create an antifragile architecture for a collective; a fragile collective will have low odds of creating antifragile architectures for both antifragile and fragile individuals.

  How to differentiate between famous artists and actual, infamous artists:
  
  1. Infamous artists are accurate, antifragile, have testable [[Autodidactic]] skills and have fucked up institutions and won.
  2. Famous artists are fragile, inaccurate, bend over for institutions and will lose forever for the paycheck.

"The youth are inaccurate and fragile; the elderly are inaccurate and antifragile.

The 99.9% would rather die than learn; I would rather die than talk with non-intellectuals, but I will aid them to prevent death by fragility, while critiquing it accurately and humorously, like through a fictional excerpt of a Punk song / magic spell sent back from the future, called [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Bestideas.lol]] ""
