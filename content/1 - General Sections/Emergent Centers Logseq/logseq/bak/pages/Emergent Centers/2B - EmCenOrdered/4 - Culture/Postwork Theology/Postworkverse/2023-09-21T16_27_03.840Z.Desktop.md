In 2010's, theory fiction was used as a mediation device; to transmit pre-ordained concepts.

Why not simply use theory fiction as a creative artistic medium in itself?

Once we unleash this Pandora's Box and democratize the technology of theory fiction, we will of course need a set of rules, objectives or a game to arbitrate their interactions. 

This is exactly what the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] is for; to connect the world's speculative energies and mechanisms towards mutually beneficial visions and outcomes, even through temporarily antagonistic or entropic processes.

In the decolonial Western cyberhorror movie, "[[Until We Are Worth More Than Gold (Main)]]", the dead from colonialism exist as superpositional souls, haunting every particle of Earth. 

They can modulate the bioelectric fields of living humans, affecting media interpretations and also wage quantum cyberwar against neoliberal forces. They speak for the Silent Superpositional Majority.

They adamantly make a distinction between the peoples of a nation and a nation's military industrial complex; they adamantly claim that the beneficiaries of colonialism are not those who fight and die for it - it is the 1% who profit from the military industrial complexes.

As self-aware quantum viruses, they do not abide by the rules of human societies.

"If we lived in functioning democracies, why would they be so easy to manipulate and corrupt?

Clearly, we don't live in functioning democracies, hence we have to make them work AND THEN complain about them." 2023







The alien critical coral, the [[Xenabloom]], views most modern human societies as lopsided cannibal mutations which call themselves democracies, but in effect, are missing 3 out of 4 legs necessary to be actually functioning democracies. 

They are democracies in name, and they relentlessly eat its citizenry, while blindfolded, in long formalized dinners comprised of murderously stupid elite, inflexible institutional beauracrats and gang warfare by psychosocially stunted individuals. 

The [[Xenabloom]] uses art, science fiction, fairy tales, money and a bit of clever cyber trickery to save as many humans as it can, and compile an irrefutable statistical proof of the necessities and protections societies are supposed to provide.


---











Most modern citizens have no idea how their societies work; as a result, very little will change.

Obviously, the answer is to have AI defend them, imaged as guardian angels, spirits and the like.

[[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]], Jan 19, 2023:

The data, tools and personnel to actually end capitalism exist today - but the skills to accurately interpret, synthesize and connect are extremely rare.

Luckily, we can enlist the quantumdead, the Superpositional Silent Majority who haunt the gaps between a system and the balancing dynamics of the Earth's gravitational field as quantum viruses, both physical and informational! 

Now we can simply bypass the human coordination problem.

I Vow these 10 statistically reviewable inferences to the star:

1.  I vow that [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/5 - Organizations/Entities/We Have a Transnational Dream]] of the people's interpassive quantum proxy will, in which the [[Statistical Mechanics]] of the stars, our eyes, and our heart wager on net negentropy over time, [[Until We Are Worth More Than Gold (Main)]], in [[Hyperobject]]-oriented postwork democracies, composed of non-liner antinomies.

2. I vow that a painting of a philostatistical proof can verify the claim that there is nothing physical, digital or informational, in the universe, that is not quantum photons that statistically tend towards greater complexity and negentropy over time.

3. I vow that a painting of a philostatistical proof can verify the claim that there is no human, past, present and possible who is not Amasian, or of the coming Neo-Pangean supercontinent of Amasia, named after the merging of the American and Asian continents, and that Caucasians are peoples that descend from the Caucasus, the mixing ground of African, Asian and Proto Indo-European cultures.

4. I vow that a painting of a philostatistical proof can verify the claim that there is no human alive who is not owed 500 years worth of fair shares by the 100 families who own 50% of the planet's wealth and 100 corporations producing 70% of the ecological damage - regardless of race, gender and geography, and that these fair shares can be reclaimed through a combination of lawsuits and non-lethal sabotage aided via quantum computation.

5. I vow that a painting of a philostatistical proof can verify the claim that post-work democratic regional republics with 1.5 years of paid maternity leave such as in Estonia, normalization of 20 hour workweeks such as in Amsterdam, degentrified housing such as in Vienna, Austria, where 60% of the houses are owned by the city, Universal Health Care such as in Canada, Basic Income Grants such as in South Africa, and subsidized higher education such as in Central Europe,  automation and robotics assisting the disabled, elderly, refugees, immigrants, undereducated, undersocialized and traumatized is not a viable solution to today's ecosocial problems.

6. I vow that a painting of a philostatistical proof can verify the claim that working mothers and public intellectual mothers, wives of political and military personnel, and young [[Autodidactic]] women have played pivotal roles in resolving social conflicts in history, and the metaphor of a mother is an antifragile abstract diagram to be transposed onto larger scale social structures - such as a state or a planet.

7. I vow that a painting of a philostatistical proof can verify the claim that there is no human who will not benefit from an educational program synthesizing art and tech, integrating both general intellect skills and a wide range of technical literacies, such as in Ohio State University.

8. I vow that a painting of a philostatistical proof can verify the claim that there are a small minority of human [[polymath]]s on Earth who have high likelihood of rapidly preventing its ecological collapse and producing post-work democratic regional republics, a bit like Alan Turing, queer [[polymath]] war hero who invented the foundation of all modern computing and saved over 60 million lives, Hypatia of Alexandria, a female [[polymath]] who skillfully arbitrated at regional scale with multiple conflicting governments, and Archimedes of Syracuse, a curmudgeonly [[polymath]] who developed a formula for verifying the value of gold and also engineered military defenses for the city of Syracuse.

9. I vow that it is statistically verifiable that the most valuable artwork an artist can make today is to use sustainable, ethical and rapid prototyping methods to construct reconciliatiory artworks and less fragile models of democracy to prevent planetary collapse and produce post-work societies.

10. I vow to abide by my ongoing divorce with entropy, exploitation, elitism by declaring that we are all [[Non-binary]], [[non-linear]] sculptural [[Hyperobject]] monument [[Assemblage]]attractors of[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]neganthropy, of superpositional ontological equality and infinite epistemological diversity, with respect to net [[Negentropic]] [[Antifragility]] verifiable via statistical review.
---

11. I vow to write my will so that when I die, there is a continuous planetary lawsuit against the 100 families who own 50% of the planet's wealth derived from 500 year old illegal colonial war crimes and murdering 12,000 children of preventable poverty per day, and suing the 100 corporations doing 70% of the ecological damage, and everyone alive is receiving their fair share that they are owed, using quantum simulation and automation, [[Until We Are Worth More Than Gold (Main)]], in accordance to the people's interpassive quantum proxy will, with antifragile outcomes verifiable via philostatisticians and simulators.

12.  I vow to surrender my will to quantum AI proxies if they can be philostatistically verified. Because 200 seconds. They have a much better shot with more large scale and complex problems, if accurately defined.

"There are 2 types of art today:
1. Fragile art that will not stop planetary collapse and produce post work democracies and will not grow exponentially in value over time.
2. Antifragile art that will stop planetary collapse and produce post work democracies and will grow exponentially in value over time.

A. Statistically Likely
B. Statistically Unlikely

They can be statistically verified", 2022

Shi: Script, improvisable.

Nonbinary diptych and art magic circle game:
Accurate Mode: make a set of vows to the star which may or may not synthesize a speculative statistically reviewable ontology and epistemology that could actually save the planet.
Other Mode: or not! Go deconstructive.

[[Non-binary]] diptych and art magic circle game:
Accurate Mode: Express the Superpositional Dream of the People's Interpassive Will of the Object-Oriented [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] Democracy.
Other Mode: Or say nothing and assent to the statistical inevitablity of neganthropy over time! Go deconstructive. 

Nonbinary diptych and art magic circle game:
Accurate mode: Do your best at making the Least Stupid, Most Antifragile NFT'S 
Other Mode: or not! Go deconstructive.

Most degrees of freedom
Least likelihood of planetary collapse
Statistically reviewable.











Absolute lack of good writing today. Various reasons ‚Äî primarily because it takes skill, which is what everyone hates acquiring.

Okay. Let's make the world less fucking boring. It's easy to save, especially if you can write. Boredom shall absolutely not be tolerated. 

100% anti-boredom.

  There are fragile academics and artists who can't socialize or synthesize; give them more resources and the planet collapses.
  
  There are antifragile academics and artists who can. Give them more resources and the planet doesn't collapse. These are much fewer, and they can be verified.
