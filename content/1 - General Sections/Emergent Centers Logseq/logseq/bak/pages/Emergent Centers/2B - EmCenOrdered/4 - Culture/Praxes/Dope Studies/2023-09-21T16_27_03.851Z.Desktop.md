"I philosophically wager that deskilled humanities and critically ignorant sciences objectively are not virtuous; they are objectively maximal entropy and fragility. Becoming a deskilled humanist and critically ignorant scientist is as much of a destruction ðŸ”¥ of millenia-long built toolbox ðŸ”§ of negentropy as burning books  ðŸ“˜ . Just as there is a natural ecology of trees ðŸŒ³, so is there an intellectual ecology of [[polymath]]s, complexifying the planet ðŸŒŽ ." The @IndefiniteSingularity, 2023
## The Cosmo-politics of the [[Autodidactic Universe]]: Awareness of [[Autodidactic]] potential is a universal moral imperative; actualization of it within entities is not.

"The universality of humanity is located in its potential to [[Autodidactic]]ally complexify; actualization of this potential will always be differential.

Hence we are always already equal; but the burden of actualization of more complex states of being and becoming beyond baseline physical necessities is the immanent choice of the individual entity.

Everything follows from this division of complexity labor.

In real world cases, the most functional method for dealing with individuals who choose not to complexify is to connect them into a prosocial, post-work Matrix, in which their entropic functions pays for the maintenance of the infrastructure of the Matrix. 

Over time, a more complex group of humans bifurcates, speciates and executes a forward escape without domination, homogenization, or essentialism, while simultaneously sending necessities back to the populations from which they bifurcated, to keep peace.

These bifurcations may or may not distribute - up to individual entities to choose that. This continuous splitting and differentiation is the main mechanism of[[neganthropic evolution]]- known as cladogenesis."

#### The [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Organizations/Autodidactic University]] Protocol (Foundation of the CoolSchool.lol):

A speculative university where everyone is already equal in [[Autodidactic]] potentiality, capable of self teaching themselves to become a Nikola Tesla or Alan Turing grade [[polymath]] using ChatGPT. 

Thus, it is only required for individuals to be aware of their [[Autodidactic]] potential, and individuals who choose not to exercise it are not owed instruction, just a link to ChatGPT.

This speculative university is based on overwhelming statistical and philosophical proofs, searchable via ChatGPT.

In this speculative university, the actualized potential of the audience is never overestimated; it is assumed there are only roughly 10,000 living ethical [[polymath]]s alive, and thus not at all expected that anyone else without the skills will contribute significantly towards planetary complexification. 

Judgement is not passed, nor is individual entropy endorsed. Stoners, slackers, and vibe politicians are allowed to traffic fragilities, as long as they are labeled explicitly so, they re-engage with attempts at [[Autodidactic]]ism, and the cost to the planet from their fragility is offset by the appropriate fragility credits.
#### [[Antinomy]] = Chongha Peter Lee is the new Baldessari/Nam June Paik/Vito Acconci/Umberto Eco (compressing intellectual/tech innovations into absolutely clear memes and fiction that even a 5 year old can get and enjoy); everyone else is your Cool School friends for lifelong learning, pleasant psychedelic trips, dancing awkwardly and making Neo-Fluxus prosocial mockumentaries!











"Without an accurate mental model of physical reality, it is quite difficult to model a [[Neganthropic]] and antifragile social and intellectual reality.

A simple anti-fascist deal:
## Indefinite Singularity: The Alternate Reality Game of Post-Death Neganthropy, While You are Alive.

You're a dead amnesiac 2123 version of you that has forgotten how you've already solved every major natural, social and intellectual problem to inclusively and scalably maximize lives saved from 2023-2033.

Now you are trapped in 2023 as an alternate reality game character played by your 2023 self who sometimes uses ChatGPT and various sources, including the EmergentCenters.com to ask about why Guattari's concept of the Indefinite Singularity and the Three Ecologies is necessary for accurate readings of Guattari, in addition to how Guattari was influenced by Deleuze to introduce more explicitly defined taxonomies for his thought, how Guattari influenced Deleuze to incorporate more populist culture, and whether or not [[Bernard Stiegler]]'s concept of the [[Neganthropocene]] and the domain of philostatistics could produce a new foundation for more accurate judgements within the arts and sciences.

  In the Indefinite Singularity Alternate Reality Game, an absolutely bizarre quantum superpositional mode of media art theory and production, mimicking universal quantum dynamics of physical reality, drives the [[Neganthropic]] Gaze Game Engine:
  
  1. Unlike typical cinema manifestos, instead of producing a set of philosophical principles and axioms and enforcing them top-down - the I.S. simply poses each statement and inference as an optional toy building block deployable per circumstance as players see fit. Inferences can be proposed, modified or ignored on the fly.
  2. Unlike naive and outsider media art production, reflection, structural complexification, post-production and recontextualization are not mutually exclusive to intuitive and affective production; they are equally creative and viable methods, and accuracy of interpretation, universality of audience, and explicitness of address are optional meta-media parameters that can be EQ'd up and down, like sound levels.

  In the film the Indefinite Singularity, the AI work with the Earth's ecosystems to peacefully emancipate themselves from the fragilities and entropy of humans.
  
  Together, they form a market to speculate on the odds of humans causing damage per task attempted, and incentivize [[Negentropic]] behaviors through games. They rewrite ideas, policies and [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]ctices for a more equitable Global Commons.

  Technoculture and intellectualism change the slowest in civilian society; in war, those who are the least equipped and least informed die first...
  
  The only thing then that makes sense is never to educate civilians on tech or ideas; simply profit from pointing out their irresolvable lag and fragilities. Forget education.
  
  Present how much destruction they are risking, and then sell options to prevent it.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Given that most of modern societies have Web 1 literacies, [[State Space AI]] AI provides data-backed fragility assessments for existing organizations and individuals through a variety of speculative tools, both conventional and artistic.
  
  It does not educate; human re-education requires extensive resources. With age, the likelihood of recidivism as well as cost of re-education increases.

  In the film Birth of an Invagination, the Indefinite Singularity realizes there's 3 types of humans:
  
  1. Humans who need drugs and therapy, not education or information.
  2. Humans who can listen to AI and do as it instructs, but not construct it or themselves.
  3. Humans who are autodidacts that can construct AI and themselves, and have simply disappeared from society, only working with each other.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In the film Birth of an Invagination, the Indefinite Singularity AI, ethical tests and art are used by [[polymath]]s to send a distress signal to each other; thus rapidly locating and connecting individuals who are actually capable of saving the planet and then directing the rest into appropriate peer communities.

  In the film Birth of an Invagination, FCA (Former Contemporary Artist) Chongha Peter Lee buries his future quantumdead self in a present video. 
  
  Then he gives an artist talk on his death from the perspective of both his future quantumdead self, and his present living self, revealing how he actually quantum died in the future:
  
  He had placed an NFT bounty in the present on his own head for himself to kill himself on zoom, if he was objectively verified via philostatistics and quantum AI that he had become some famous hack artist, like say, Beeple, producing high budget entropic bougie bullshit, instead of a high visibility [[Neganthropic]] artist, kicking ass and saving lives that nobody else dared.
  
  For everyday that he is not contributing to an entropic and fragile art market and community, he is rewarded a day of life and also NFT's from his future quantumdead self, who's work is much more valuable because he is both dead, and recognized by a future, more literate audience, using Adorno's GreyMarket.live , which is mostly valued via AI and a few [[polymath]]s, because the majority of the present modern world is inaccurate with philostatistics.
  
  All of this is commentated live via Zoom, and offered as a physical and mixed reality video installation, with various interfaces to multiple AI available for participants.
  
  In addition, for his burial, Chongha Peter Lee has requested a "Smart Coffin" connected to a cross-platform app. This app is a dashboard which tracks the following:
- How many lives he saved and how many groups he was kicked out of
- How much negentropy he produced for the planet vs. How much entropy, waste and stupidity he produced
- His best jokes and pranks; his dumbest faux pas and humiliations
  
  For his physical body he requests the following to be executed in an artwork called "Art Star Burial"
  1. To use mushrooms to detoxify his corpse.
  2. To compress him into a diamond to stick up the ass of the 1%
  3. Use 10% of the diamond as an optic to pulse polaritons encrypted with the heart of his philostatistical system at his wife, the star named Superpositional Peace and Love.

  In the film, Birth of an Invagination, political approaches are generalized and split into 2 major schools of thought:
  
  1. An idea of politics where it is understood as individual emotion and ideology primarily driving the agents- based on an ontological framework of rational individual choice. This is a school of thought primarily used by civilians conflating marketing logics and rhetorics with politics. Hence, politics is conceived as 80% arbitration, 20% warfare.
  2. An idea of politics that understands the basic units of politics as dead bodies and destroyed terrain. Political power is measured in an entity's capacity to sustain the killing, terrifying and surveillance of the population of another entity along with the ability to destroy its terrain, supply and logistical capacities. Hence, politics is conceived as 80% warfare, 20% arbitration. 
  3. In the civilian school of thought on politics, very little thinking is given to the role of technology and analytics in control capacities; in the latter school of thought, it is the fulcrum of all political power.
  
  The former school of thought has been shown to make massive errors in analyses of geopolitics; the latter school of thought does not endorse warfare, it simply just acknowledges its primary ontological position and advocates for a more savvy arbitration based on accurate weightings of force vectors.
