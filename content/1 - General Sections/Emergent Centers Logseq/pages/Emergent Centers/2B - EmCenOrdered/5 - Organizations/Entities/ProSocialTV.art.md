- What is ProSocialTV.art?

- It is a multi-cast network mixing multiple paradigms of TV public culture and media art literacies.

- The content is explicitly prosocial only; meaning that all production is focused on creating positive outcomes for society, even if they are simply just playful.

- Prosocial does not mean the tone has to be positive only. Negative tones, processes, and outcomes are understood to be temporary components of longer term prosocial outcomes.

- Verification of what will produce more prosocial outcomes is done via [[SRP]], or the [[Statistical Review Protocol]], with more complex claims require more complex processes of verification.

- As such, ProSocialTV.art has a singular unified outcome, but its methods are distributed, recombinable and improvisable.
