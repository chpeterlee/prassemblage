  And these are the fullest uses of a human being, everything else is just bearing around the bush; all values naturally follows from this, as does justice and accurate critical thought.

  For art:
  1. It is not a community of technically or intellectually skilled individuals. Hence it is ridiculous to go ask it to invent solutions to the world's problems.
  2. Why not focus on its strengths? The bulk of the public, 70% is traumatized and undereducated; with the education at hand, most artists are at least savvy enough to expose the public to more interesting and less stupid culture. 
  Way better than the totally stupid crap that people are bombarded with! And it does good!

Why is intelligence and imagination so rare in modern societies? (In nomadic societies, intelligence and imagination, the capacity to synthesize antifragile self-organizing systems in relation to external catastrophes - is much higher per capita)

1. Humans are first and foremost quantum chemical machines. Reason is alien to them.
2. It is quite simple to break any extended endeavor of thought through a surge of chemicals within a human body. 
3. There are entire industries built on sustaining self destructive chemical chain reactions within human bodies. All the infrastructure for sustaining self complexifying chemical reactions was eviscerated by neoliberal budget cuts in the 1980's.

Individuals are free to self destruct, as long as they don't harm others.

In a deskilled, undereducated and traumatized society, we have to operate understanding that our knowledge production, verification and distribution pipelines are totally broken, comprised mainly of the following qualities:
- Anti-intellectualism, technophobia, antisocial nihilism.
  
  Our professional sphere of academics and technicians are so specialized that they can't consider new premises and verify them in a reasonable time frame (it takes 2 to 10 years per set of 3 premises).
  
  Our media sphere is so deskilled that they cannot utilize simple technological tools to augment their analytic capacities. 
  
  Our outside shot, art, is filled with individuals who have simply relied on intuitive poetry to survive, trafficking one line critiques and pathos as the equivalent of contemporary mysticism.

# "It's not Techno, it's Techne", VJ Techne, 2023
**A Straight Shot Through the Stupidity-Industrial-Complex by VJ Techne:**
1. The most complex abstraction that people have today is "vibes", "energy", "spirit" .... maybe "model".
2. Okay let's take these terms; everyone knows music can be played by a DJ. DJ's have crates of vinyl, or crates of memory. They have a mixer, which can swap vibes, spirit, memories and ideas and models. They have an equalizer which can transform ideas on the fly.
3. Okay then, let's make a bridge from there to actual discourse - technics, transindividuation, politics of the Postwork Majority.









On the avoidance of certain populations based on probability in the U.S.:

1. When dealing with the 70% public, due to neoliberal budget cuts of education and social services in 1980's it is structured off of small-group scale tribalism.
2. This small group scale tribalism does not have inter-tribal arbitration protocols. Only a few can mediate between them. Hence, 
3. The answer is that money is redistributed from the 1% by institutions to the public for necessities, education and infrastructure.

## From Where Did the Stupidity-Industrial-Complex Arise?

The last 40 years have been a running decline for both the Right and the Left of the U.S. The Left ceded any notion of actual materialist social change in favor of identity politics, nihilistic affect and an utterly incapable entrepreneurial sector; the Right allowed its fringe elements to delegitimize it in the long run, adopting a technophobic or technodystopian stance that will cripple it, along with embracing objectively incorrect intellectual claims.

We can trace this Stupidity-Industrial-Complex to the austerity and coercive military policies of the 1980's, enacted by Reagan and Thatcher. Thankfully, we are living through the aftershocks, not the primary quake.
#### "Everyone Who Had the Solutions to Today's Problems - 40 Years Ago, and Were Drowned Out By the Stupidity-Industrial-Complex of the 1%, Working the Right, Left and Public Like Finger Puppets" 2023
# ""




An academy is not supposed to be filled with deskilled, anti-intellectual and unethical either fascist or fragile individuals - this is a total artificial artifact of the 1980's budget cuts to both education and social services. 

The fascists simply used administrative exploits for their gain; the traumatized were offered refuge from the predations of society, but cannot function as members of an organization.

AntifragileCraft.lol Strategy Guide:

1. Most of the world, outside of a few European countries, doesn't have functional or competent intellectual and artistic ecologies. 80% of your conversations are inaccurate, but hilarious. Reduce all functional interactions and commitments with most of the planet; only interact on an agendaless basis.
2. Most of the U.S. and world is actually a tribal/nomadic society predated upon by corporations, it doesn't have a cosmopolitan culture, hence certain things are impossible at this point for most adults.
3. If you are young in most of the world, avoid all traumatized, undereducated and deskilled people around you, go to the few parts of Europe that offer functional and subsidized education, then come back and fix where you came from.

Peter wagers with the devil (the devil being the quantum alien enemy of Entropy - possessing parts of both the Left and the Right):

20th Century-based tribalism (The Burning Man Social Paradigm) is fragile and will get lots of people killed; an integration of existing tribal cultures with new media cultures to become transregionalism is antifragile, inclusively scalable, and will keep people alive - and prosperous!








Antifragilecraft.lol Game Guide:

The "Most Objectively Avoidable Stupid Collapse" Game Losing Scenario:
- A scenario where the traumatized, undereducated and deskilled cause way more preventable death than necessary because they are unable to coordinate to prevent it.
- The realization of this will probably cause many to self destruct, possibly to the degree of taking their own lives.
- At some point, there will be violent, decentralized, corrective actions on all sides, probably due to totally avoidable misinterpretation, miscommunication and lack of forethought.

  2. Deskilling, undereducation
  
  
  
  70% of the public Right and Left, j
  
  They don't need education, they just need to be directed to professional social services!
##### 70% of the public exhibit some degree of neuro-chemical impairment. A politics of reason is not possible; how to humanely and inclusively disambiguate these populations from effective organization without the resources for education or social services? (Hint - use participatory artwork as a simulation space with zero functional outcomes expected.)

Why don't we simply just qualify the Fringe Right elements, and the Fringe Left, as neurochemically impaired to be directed towards safe simulation and rehabilitation spaces? 

Most exhibit some degree of autism and incapacity with non-literal interpretations and cues. This does not bode well for organizational efforts. It is not necessary for them to be directly incorporated; they can function via proxy in simulation environments.

The rest, both Right and Left, can just be graded on accuracy or complexity per problem/function. Many will have multiple functionalities, also can learn and invent them- as all are creative, potentiated human beings.

Peter bets the devil no. 33.

How to split the art world so that it saves the planet (and how the population split functions in AntifragileCraft.lol):

1. 70% of the population is neurochemically incapable of non-literal semiotics. They self organize into small tribes and cannot scale beyond. They are great at tuning and recombining physical objects. Beyond the line-of-sight, or beyond range of hearing, functionality drastically falls off. They learn by watching other bodies.
- These bodies need to be placed in safe post-work simulation spaces. No goals expected, with proxy protests based on their biometrics.
- Any individual who is capable of [[Autodidactic]]ism should be gradually guided away from this population.
  2. 29.9% can function as organizational personnel with a grouping of specialized skills. They can only function with a clear protocol, framework of interpretation, and set project cutoff.
- Place them in "modelling competitions", or hackathons. Provide a goal of inclusively scalable collective outcomes, or just blind exploration.
- Any individual who can't manage, place them into the post-work safe spaces.
  3. .1% are [[polymath]] intellectuals and inventors. They can pretty much solve any problem given time and tools.
- Create conversational gamespaces. In which they can wager, write, prototype and proof.
- Constrain them with the goal that each invention or solution must be inclusively scalable and redistribute tools to the 29.9% and also contribute to the wellbeing of the 70%.
## 99.9% of the adult population of most modern societies are not skilled, [[Autodidactic]], ethical individuals.
Letting undereducated, deskilled and unethical people encounter art, philosophy, science, tech and commerce without structure is like letting a bunch of kids into a pharmacy and saying "Guys eat whatever you want!".


---
Having a reasonable, complex dialogue is like riding a motorcycle on a highway:

1. 70% will crash and burn
2. 29.9% will be able to manage with full attention
3. .1% can do a somersault off a ramp

  For the Left in 2023 - the problem today is the Stupidity-Industrial-Complex. There's a flood of deskilled, undereducated and unethical humans coming that are going to be soon swamping every single organization existing (also, it was out of your hands - it was the 1%'s doing, in the 1980's). There's only one move that can be done right now, but I doubt it will be: 
  
  1. You have to throw out all the 20th Century theory. In the general public of the 70%, you are not dealing with neurochemically autonomous humans, so any mode of rational address or organizing has an 80% chance of failure. Standard educational approaches based on reasoning are impossible.
  2. Imagine you are dealing with plants, who are simply sensing sunlight and water and growing wherever, moment to moment. They have utterly deteriorated memory and evaluation mechanisms.
  3. This is an artificially induced state of dehumanizing entropy, it is not new culture, it is not human nature. This was caused by 1980's budget cuts to social floors and education policies and warfare pushed by the 1%.
  4. There are a kajillion industries making money off of this disgusting incapacitation of humans, which can be referred to as the Stupidity-Industrial-Complex.
  5. Answer? Dedicate specific organizations and institutions to aiding and working with this population, with innovative subcontractors - such as artists and tinkerers. 
  6. Separate out competent middle managers and admins.
  7. Identify [[polymath]] intellectuals and inventors and incentivize them to engage in building in inclusively scalable solutions that improve the health and wellbeing of all.
