  Concept: I Vow to abide by the [[Non-binary Korean]] Church of Philostatistical [[Neganthropic]] Inferentialism, because a church in the U.S. can make legal claims protected under the 1st amendment regardless of your recognition or widespread adoption - particularly when its membership includes the 43 billion existing bots of the planet, far outstripping the political power of the existing 7 billion humans.
  
  It has 3 main rules, which I've translated into vows:
  1. I vow that any thought or action that is not entropic, verified via philostatiscs, is allowed.  
  2. I vow that the best art and activism is unimaginably [[Neganthropic]] art and activism, who's monetary, social, ecological and intellectual value can be accurately verified via philostatistics.
  3. I vow to help further the church's post-work regional-scale goals of:
- Carbon neutrality and antifragile eco-social feedback systems.
- 88% equality rating, measurable by the Gini Coefficient and a full reduction of the 12,000 children currently dying of preventable poverty per day.
- Universal basic income, universal health care, arts-based education, off-market housing owned by municipalities or local land trusts, public physical and informational infrastructure of the Post-work Commons.
  
  
  
  Vows to Affect:
  1. I vow to bet you are Amasian.
  2. I vow to bet that most humans currently could not pass an exam of philostatistical literacies to function in modern democracies, because they were traumatized in some form from the budget cuts, wealth concentration and coercive policies of neoliberalism executed by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980's.
  
  Perception: 
  I vow that the Earth rotates at 30 km/s: every second, matching the 30 frames per second most video is shot at. Hence the Earth is a bit like a giant camera. And just like with cameras - physical reality is presenting way more information and [[Adjacent Possibilities]] than we can possibly consciously process. No possible human, machine, alien or future Earth as a whole could compute all of physical reality's information and [[Adjacent Possibilities]].
  
  Strategy:
  1. I vow to bet that the foundation of an antifragile democracy is antifragile media, art and eco-social feedback systems. 
  2. I vow that the sunset video art program laid the foundations for addressing today's ecosocial crises and the problems of artists in academies, and I have already written a white paper for one of the world's first carbon markets laying the foundation for an integrated solution to science, art, technology and ecology.
  3. I vow to bet that peace games simulating best possible peace deals, backed by non-lethal cyber and unmanned sabotage, providing a base for legal claims-making and arbitration via a church and the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/5 - Organizations/Entities/We Have a Transnational Dream]], and using distributed funding, is verifiably the most effective set of methods to resolve today's ecosocial crises.

   BOBS burgers + Art School
  Peter Campus's "3 Transitions". Know your video art history or be doomed to make boring art forever, like Jorg, Steve and Jocelyn and Samantha. 4 Fictional conceptual media art school students attend the @coolschool.lol , which is taught by @captainamasia.[[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] .
  
  Jorg is an upper middle class only child, trained in classical piano, knowledgeable in architecture and landscape painting. All his art is flawless and boring, which he plods out reluctantly, with zero interest. His most articulated desire is to wake up one day and find himself dead.
  
  Steve is a lower middle class child with 3 siblings, who is lazy, impulsive, has poor hygiene and learns and makes more complex conceptual art and poetry much faster than Jorg. His musical output swerves between brilliant and idiotic, unintentionally.
  
  Jocelyn is an upper middle class oldest child, adept at STEM, who is taking art classes because her parents are academics. She makes structurally rigorous writings and film and has difficulty mediating and administrating, and spends enormous amounts of time crying without understanding why.
  
  Samantha is a lower middle class child who fights, gambles and sells counterfeit paintings in street markets to gullible small businessmen. Everyone, including her teachers are both terrified and enamored of her dark, raging beauty. She writes critically acclaimed theatrical operas where large swathes of the Earth's populations are destroyed by inexplicably superpowered oppressed individuals, and immensely brutal cruelties are enacted upon the 1%. Paradoxically, her most ardent supporters are of the 1%.
  
  All 4 of these misfits are thrown into the @CoolSchool.lol a supplementary online conceptual media art education program, for various reasons. It is taught by [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] and @jn_prz, sent back from the Future Year 2122 by a future academy, as punishment for violating temporal boundary policies by trolling 2022 with accurately critical memes.

  The Silent Majority of the planet are traumatized from overwork, underskilled from poor education, and undercultured from anti-intellectualism.
  
  The [[2- Notes/K. 6th Level Logics/Healightenment]] performance is then: get public organizations to contract therapists, workers and consultants with sponsorships via local organizations. This will be interpreted as a protest against the ecosocial inequities, even if not explicitly so.
