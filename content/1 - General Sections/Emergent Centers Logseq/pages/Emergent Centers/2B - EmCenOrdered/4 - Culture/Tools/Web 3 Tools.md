- 2. Convert to web 3 (Roam and Notion):
	- Anything to Roam
		- god this is nuts - heres the pipeline for Anything > Roam:
		  1. Export [x] to html
		  2. Append [x] and slice it into chunks using an html joining/splitting service.
		  3. Import it into Notion.
		  4. Export to .md
		  5. Upload to Roam
		- This will be able to intake anything and preserve most of the structure
		- Notion is flexible that it can pretty much output to anything - so it's pretty much a universal file converter

			- you should look into the Twitch Clips interactions, because the community could produce a ton of streams on the main acct, host the shows out to their twitch channels we make for them, then everyone and anyone could make these little Clips of parts they liked or thought were useful or funny, and those clips get stored on twitch but also could be linked out to IG wherever.
	- How to Host
		- fyi to host someone manually, you go to your own chat box (found under stream manager in your twitch dashboard) and type /host [username]
		- the stream manager is here, but replace gameseum with your own channel name
		- https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/gameseum/stream-manager
		- so that's dashboard.twitch.tv/u/<yourChannelName>/stream-manager
		- i'm gonna hop on twitch and try to learn some neos through the tutorial world
