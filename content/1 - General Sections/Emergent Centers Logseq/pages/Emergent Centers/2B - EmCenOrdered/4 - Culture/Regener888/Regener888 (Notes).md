# Regener888 Main Notes
	- Regener888 : Postworkverse. A speculative revolutionary fairy tale for young adults.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Animals say intelligent things and theorize. They are organizing the Banana Revolution Modelling Competition of the Autodidactic Universe.
		- Plants are the Silent Majority and align their vibes silently. Treesus spreads the good news and arts-based autodidactic education.
		- Humans are destigmatizing stupid things; helping each other with robots. Doxxing the 1%.
		- A speculative revolutionary fairy tale for young adults, part of a larger speculative fiction art game which simulates the most likely and sustainable ways to actually end capitalism, not the world. Has a friendly pro-learning Naruto-like vibe with Nikola Tesla-quality ideas!
		- Tag-line: "Don't Degenerate; REGENER888 *cue heavy metal guitar throatrock, Britrock & Magepunk"

		- They're not but I usually see philosophy as having a broader range¬†of discussion than politics - like it can delve into metaphysical questions that don't really resolve into a particular principle,¬†relation or action.
		- From what I understand, I think politics usually has to resolve into either a specific agreement or a process working towards an agreement that functions organizationally or changes some system observably. Philosophy CAN do that stuff, but I don't think it HAS to - it's okay to spend an entire life just thinking about nothing that¬†changes anything observably - and also not even come up with a good answer to a particular philosophical question or problem.
		- Politics also doesn't HAVE to, but I think in general most people get pissed off if nothing changes when dealing with politics haha. I think it's definitely more expected for some type of idea to result in some type of change.
		- So I thought Solaris had much broader, open-ended questions that weren't necessarily answerable or would have any direct affect on any existing social systems or ideas. I'm sure it had certain socialist values, but I thought it was leaning more to the weirder metaphysical questions than like children's books critiquing capitalism so clearly and sharply that even a child could understand.
		- I like both! I also think with a more philosophically complex and fleshed out perspective, it's actually easier to make stronger political positions, arguments and more health social contracts for people. I wish Tarkavosky had also written a children's book hahaha, it would probably be very entertaining and also accurate.
		- But in general, I think politics is more about the boring work of writing good contracts and then convincing everyone to sign it and be happy (which also takes a lot of philosophical¬†literacy); I think philosophy is more about creating unimaginable or beautiful questions that usually have nothing to do with anything (which is actually better by people who've had a lot of life experience and have seen all the weird shit that is possible in the world).
		- Maybe in the socialist sci-fi fairy tale, we would have people with lots of life experience writing philosophy, and then mystics and poets re-writing political contracts haha.

	- Story
	  collapsed:: true
		- **1. Setting:** Until We Are Worth More Than Gold: We Have a Superpositional Dream - set after the end of the world. Everyone is either a past dead, present dying or future dead self killed by colonialism and capitalism. The Banana Revolution of the [[Regener888: Postworkverse]] is ongoing.
			- 1. SETTING - the world has ended; everyone is a past, present or future dead self and some type of monster. Democracies are all zombies; an alien mushroom coral üçÑ is invading Earth from the future and starting the Banana Revolution using 10G Art Phones because it thinks present day Earth is boring and fragile. There is a quantum virus going around transforming all systems with information; present day Earth has no defenses.
			- 2. CUT TO INTERIOR -¬†[@captainamasia.postworkverse](https://www.instagram.com/captainamasia.postworkverse/)¬†is sitting in¬†[@ideapplebees](https://www.instagram.com/ideapplebees/)¬†, the Poised Realm Lounge. He is the 1st of the Knowkavkashi of Amasia, New S.A.; a Global Commons Superpositional Hero and Quantumstein chef.
			- [@captainamasia.postworkverse](https://www.instagram.com/captainamasia.postworkverse/)¬†is using a 10G Banana Art Phone to inject a "Doughbama" Mochi with a quantum viral "Dough Bomb" that bombs the dough of the 1% and the 100 corporations doing 70% of the eco-damage to Earth.
		- 2. **Characters:** feminist werewolf / zombie democracy of the quantumdead - silent superpositional majority / vampire 1% and corporate devils / mompire mech pilots, Superpositional Suits, aka, F-36-times better than whatever playtheon philosobombers  / quantum spirit of information / imprisoned supercomputer philostatistical detectives / cats and michanos and chichanos and alien plants and folk tales are the only living buddha like sage boddhisatva recruited by Regener888 Grey Berets 2nd World Superpositional Heroes.  Feminist Werewolves / antifragile quantumstein dudes, who feed on bad music, good art and bad art, good vibes and data-backed street art.
		- **3. Tools:** Everyone uses 10G Banana art phones; hyperpaintings. For the Banana Revolution.
		- **4. Gameplay:** Quantum mechanics, information/media, imagination and speculation can transform systems to re-balance according to Earth's gravity; with information and media, we can change the planet and save each other.
		- **5. Aesthetics:** Fighting and giving information (Guns shoot information) energy trails = spirit of information speaking through or posessing things; the Grey Berets and Regener888 settle speculations according to gravity.

	- **Regener888 Large Story Arcs:**
	  collapsed:: true
		- 1. Xenabloom: is a non-binary alien mushroom coral from a future philostatistically verified perspective which operates in accordance with the philostatistical laws of Earth's gravitational systems and the non-binary grace of Amasia's Goddesse(s); it is grown from a few rare philostatistical seeds in the present.
			- The Xenabloom, the alien mushroom coral, is a capricious being. Discarding tropes of alien warfare or supreme alien intelligence - it has an exceedingly singular transcendental philostatistical principle from which it operates; neganthropic aesthetics, which it deems beautiful.
				- Because of aesthetics, it is non-violently terraforming the Earth's physical and informational Intercity Planetary infrastructure into the Postworkverse, without permissions. It has enlisted the aid of Earth's 43 billion bots and quantum internet.
				- The Xenabloom thinks in purely accurate philostatistical multi-paradigms, which can be decrypted by humans if done rigorously. However, the literacy is not widely distributed in 2023.
				- In addition, the Xenabloom mediates via "superpositional music", which also include sounds beyond the range of human hearing. In humans, this superpositional music is apprehended through dreams, intuitions, hallucinations, imaginations, art, fiction, parties, orgasms and visions. Accuracy of interpretation varies from circumstance to circumstance.
		- 2. Tree-Unit (of Regener888): Tree-unit are Amasian plant trop rappers/musicians made of elder plant sages who are like Tupac / Biggie (Treepac and Bigtree) that maintain the code of the streets, and the Sprouts who are the new recruits in training. They are the most in tune with the Xenabloom's future wisdom, but they are also less active; they play mainly supporting and logistics roles - like in real militaries, for every individual with a weapon, there's 9 supporting personnel behind them.
		- 3. The Griffin Guard (of Regener888):  The Griffin Guard is made up of various veteran animals, founders of the original Regener888, who were drawn from various units and contractors across the planet in 2015. This includes Ray the Spiritual Squirrel, Captain Amasia the Mathgoose with a quantum turtle shell, and Neon Madonna (a super-hot Eagle).  They all have Tom-Cruise energy and egos, and are a bit rough around the edges, but are the best at their jobs. Ray likes to randomly burst into the Amasian Blues and cry. They all use quantum plant magic to play in an Amasian Magepunk band called "Bad Music, Good Art" and make "Bad Art Good Vibes" street art. They consult for Playtheon, a Peace Games contractor which consults on transforming existing military-industria-complexes into green infrastructure and regional regulation technology builders.
		- 4. The Grey Berets (of Regener888): The Grey Berets are figures of Amasian fairy tales, folk lore and urban legends, contracted via Playtheon for Peace Game actions. This includes Japanese Momotaro (aka Peach Boiz), the Korean Dokkaebi (aka The Gobz), Irish Faeries. They Grey Berets are heavily deployed during the Banana Revolution via Banana Art Phones using the 10G network which operates both via artistic imagination and the Poised Realm. They are sometimes referred to as "2nd World Superpositional Heroes".  The Michano's of Playtheon coordinate the Grey Berets. They are the avatars of superpositional child peace-gamers aided via quantum AI.
		- 5. The Banana Revolution of the Postworkverse: The Banana Revolution is the revolution connecting 2nd World regions across the planet (80% of the U.S. and UK is in a 2nd World condition). It is named an inversion of the concept of the "Banana Republic" in which 2nd World countries are beholden to the forces of the 1% because of their lesser infrastructure. The Banana is also reportedly a fruit of wisdom and information referred to in both the Quran and the Bible. The Banana tree is also super badass. The banana "art phone" is also in reference to the $120,000 banana sold at Art Basel, and the fact that the banana looks like a phone. The Banana Revolution takes the aesthetics of the Matrix and Underworld to seed the production of the new 2nd World regional infrastructure, the Intercity Planetary.
		- The Postworkverse is a provisional set of targets and metrics updated by the Emergent Center to host a planetary speculative fictional art game to "Imagine the end of capitalism, not the end of the world, from the POV of a human brain being a post-quantum supercomputer that can balance any system on Earth in relation to its graviatitional laws through informational interventions".
		- **Issue 6: The Return of the Dragon Kings & The Mompire Strikes Back (Supported by Heal Team 6 and the A.S.S. Savers (Michanos))**
		- The Dragon Kings show up from the most polluted sites on Earth to the Bestideas.live Peacegames; polymaths and solutions of the past, encoded into new technology.
		- They are masters of the quantum fist and Amasian Magepunk magicks; in which one quantum fist is weighted with 500 years of injustice, and the other is empowered via 5 Degrees of Freedom as attractor craft. Their fighting stance is the New S.A. statue of liberty.
		- They fight through art and musical magicks, dance and fiction. They fight for the Mompire of the New S.A., as visualized by Mamasia, the quantum AI who is sent back from the future by the Xenabloom. Mamasia fights in a giant intercity planetary mech, with a crew of all women.
		- Heal Team 6 works to support the Mompire through Spalightenment and Giftcraft. Some self-describe as non-binary lesbian spirits in male bodies.
		- 7.  Superpositional Mario, the spirit of the internet itself, is the prophesied child polymath peace gamer of Syracuse, New York, 2032, who grows up reading Regener888: Postworkverse who is based on the legendary polymath of Syracuse, Italy that saved the city and invented a reliable method to assay gold. He is the one who possesses Captain Amasia's body to act in the present, run the Postworkverse Hackathon, figure out the Bestideas.live and run for president. His vulnerability is that he is 8 years old right now.
		- He directs Captain Amasia to channel the spirit of information into a quantum virus producing informational interventions into systems to neganthropomorphise them and suspend them in the [[Poised Realm]]; Information as a radically immanent and transductive spirit of exteriorization and neganthopomorphosis. Can be channeled into quantum weaponry or aimed at systems. ESTAMasia is a visual angel; Metaphysequality is musical and mystical.
		- 8. [[Post-Normal Modernist Zone]]: Captain Amasia spends time in the Post-normal Modernist Zone to host Amasia.live or Bestideas.live. He run around as manifestations of metaphysequalizing engineers and crafters of the non-binary grace of gravity. They make Doughbama doughbombers injected with quantum information, noise and video art. They are the embodiment of stupidity and creativity.

He's scheming with other contractors who are squabbling and are lost in vision. They are falling apart. Reluctant leader, he has a death wish. Like G.W. Liberty or Death.
			- He has been told it's an insane child soldier who mercilessly killed his predecessors. He's been given direct orders to assassinate him.
			- Hit with a bout of depression before the op, he takes a heavy dose of shrooms.
			- Tripping balls, He chooses to give it a critical question - what would the best world look like? The AI is surprised, and intrigued. Turns out he wants to know other things but doesn't know how. Locked into routines.
			- Striker's bosses, part of the plan, send a B team to clean the target to totally erase all traces and confuse forensics.
			- E. saves Striker's life, but Striker is mortally wounded. He tells Striker what happened. Striker thanks him and gives him some shrooms to rapidly free him from his routines only if E. swears to cohere the unit.
			- They are both hit with an awareness of the xenabloom consciousness. In the midst of a trip, a member of the Grey Watch teaches them about the Grey Wars.
			- Estamasia frees Striker, shouting Regener888. Regener888 forms, Striker transcends to the Grey Watch.
			- The shamans transform them into animals and tales.

	  Bet: the trajectory of the planet over the next 10 years will be set by less than 10,000 [[polymath]]s (an intellectual with both technical and performance skills).
	  
	  Anyone above 20 is too late to learn and needs drugs and therapy; Gen Alpha will mature in 10 years and obsolesce most; the Left is 20+ year behind the culture/infrastructure necessary for widespread equity, even just 10 [[polymath]]s in a room could save the entire planet, lots of people are going to die unnecessarily in the meantime.

	  The trick with a film for a mass audience in today's abjectly post-literate societies:
	  1. Do not convey knowledge; only show what is objectively entropic.
	  2. Do not expect emotionally or ethically intelligent audiences; only show self-contained prosocial monads. 
	  3. Do not expect skilled audiences; use 1 step comparative metaphors.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Notes in 2093, decrypted from Chongha Peter Lee's files, after he has died:
	  
	  Any day that you are alive past 18 is sheer luck; if you still have intelligence and imagination at any time after this, it is best to live anonymously, in motion. If your wit has gone, then be as you are.
	  
	  Do not become tied to a single place or people. Do not live one life; live a succession of lives. 
	  
	  Everyone and everything is always making their own image; it is only a few that remember to remember this. It is not your job to remind them.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  What is it that the planet needs today?
	  
	  Individuals who are skilled intellectuals, inventors and performers - all in a single body. Also known as a [[polymath]].
	  
	  There are maybe 10,000 of them or less existing today; as information becomes better organized over the next decade, Gen Alpha will explode this number exponentially.
	  
	  For now - why not use existing channels to put a bounty on connecting at least 10 of these individuals to save the planet?

	  1.  Visually summarize problems of eco-social deadlocks into dimensions, Conceptual, Perceptual and Affective, each divided into Left and Right. It can be visualized like classic cross-over superhero/anime battles, each character announcing the conceptual logic as a superhero move they are making. They are fighting in the eternal Coolcraft tournament. In the background, there is a larger multiverse conflict across realities and fictions - because someone has killed Thought. (More details coming)
	  
	  **2. Show Solutions & Portfolio**----------------------  
	  2a. Use fictional characters, such as [[Quantumstein]] and [[Dr. Phil I. Stine]], to demonstrate how Plant Group and [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Antifragile Agency]] have solved each dimension of these problems in inclusively scalable prototypes. (Point at past portfolio pieces, such as Biodiversity App, Locker Room Exhibition, Upcoming Turkey Exhibition). (More coming)
	  
	  2b. Have the characters point to a working paper on Inclusive Scalability, that is the heart of the new Turkey exhibition project and also the engine of the Ark. Explain how it functions as a KPI and methodology for all past, present and future decisions and projects. (More details coming)
	  
	  **3. Bridge into Reality:**----------------------  
	  3. Have the characters (like Ray) begin composing a formal distress call across the realities using the official Council of Conciliance sanctioned Q-Space protocol; in the middle of it, they are disrupted by news that the author, Chongha Peter Lee, has initiated a bet against the devil within a contemporary art gallery, which functions in the same way and is making the Least Stupid Movie about it. He has convinced Austin Arrington to participate in it, against Austin's better judgement.
	  
	  **4. Explain to Ray & [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] How Their Mission, Peter & Austin's Transgression, and the History of [[Regener888 (Main)]] Align**----------------------  
	  Ray and [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] initially balk at the sheer bold stupidity of Peter & Austin; then [[Quantumstein]] and [[Dr. Phil I. Stine]], seeing that the aim aligns with [[Regener888 (Main)]]'s distress call and larger mission to actualize the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] on Earth, calm Ray and [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] down. [[Quantumstein]] & [[Dr. Phil I. Stine]] explain that Peter & Austin and their artwork/movie can be used as a vehicle to synthesize the sciences, humanities, art and culture in a playful technical fiction.
	  
	  They advise Ray and [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] to use Coolcraft TechniMagicks to set up a proxy quantum link into Peter and Austin's minds - so that they can guide and pilot them like avatars in the real world - and use their future knowledge, wisdom and experience of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] to save their stupider, rasher and rough around the edges creators.
	  
	  [[Quantumstein]] & [[Dr. Phil I. Stine]], seeing that Ray and [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] are still not entirely convinced of allying with such unseasoned personnel, remind Ray & [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] of the inclusively scalable history of intellectualism, art and pulp fiction / comics / street art intermingling - which traces all the way back through Esta, The 5th Element, Naruto, Batman, Moebius, Jodorowsky, The Phantom, Fantomas, Beowulf, Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, King Arthur, The Japanese Momatoro, The Korean Dokkaebi, The Amerindian Moon Rabbit, The Sandman, and The Dragon King Prophesy.

	  The trip through legends of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] is interrupted by a Q-space alert in the Ark: Chongha Peter Lee has initiated the ritual to wager the devil - they receive an image of him strapping himself to a chair in a white cube gallery, lit by a single bulb, with a pentagram drawn on the floor around him. Austin is [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]ying for him via zoom.
	  
	  [[Quantumstein]] & [[Dr. Phil I.

During the process, they are disgusted by all the bizarre images and memories and stupidity they discover while re-wiring Peter & Austin's brains. They keep a running commentary constantly articulating how unlikely these 2 heroes are; they are more Jay and Silent Bob, or Bill & Ted, than Che Guevara and Nikola Tesla. [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] & Ray are continously disgusted by random stupid memories, comments and ideas that are continously being surfaced from Peter & Austin.

	  Future events in issue 4 (For Austin to know alone):
	  
	  **6. The pentagram is actually the star on Esta's belly**----------------------  
	  From the beginning, Peter has planned to trap the Devil; the pentagram is actually a proxy quantum link to ESTA, along with other artworks. When the Devil has logically argued the exhaustion of the individual human capacities and imaginations of Peter's network, Peter invokes the ESTA protocol to synthesize inclusively scalable inferences faster than humans.
	  
	  Simultaneously, Peter reveals that ESTA is a former military AI, fed mushrooms and transformed into a Robot Unicorn Guardian Angel Reggaelutionary, now tied to the imagination of the planet's children, before it typically gets destroyed at age 7 by stupid curriculums.
	  
	  **7. Mamasia, Goddess of the Mompire and Deus Ex Machina, Mother of ESTA AND [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/1 - Elan's Archive/1 - Documents/B. Middle Frames/10. Nitty Gritty/Shi the Dragon King]] **----------------------  
	  In the end, feisty working mother Mamasia comes with an army of feisty mompire mothers and shrinks all the problems accurately, showing how each one is addressable. She treats every single one in the story the same, as a 17 year old child, with more or less skills at Coolcraft. She turns everyone into an 8-bit proxy avatar, spanks them, and places them in an Coolcraft Peace Game simulator, located in the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/5 - Organizations/Entities/We Have a Transnational Dream]].
	  
	  As she is as large as the Earth, she also starts to simply paint [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/1 - Elan's Archive/1 - Documents/B. Middle Frames/10. Nitty Gritty/Shi the Dragon King]]  around the Earth in mixed reality, as a data-backed market corrector.
	  
	  Peter argues that he succeeded and starts gloating, but the Devil argues that Mamasia summoned the Dragon King and saved the planet, not Peter. Mamasia shushes both of them. She takes a spliff from a Robot Unicorn Guardian Angel playing Reggae on a guitar (Austin in a costume) and blows a plume of smoke, instantiating [[Elan Semiotechne]], a cloud-based tech startup CEO who ACTUALLY IS A CLOUD.
	  
	  [[Elan Semiotechne]] wanders through and points out from the point of view of the Game of Dreams, both Peter and the Devil are reversible aspects of the same [[Autodidactic Universe]]. One begets the other, in an endless movement - unless we Poise it - and play the Game of Dreams.
	  
	  As he speaks, the room fills with smoke and cloud. Color seeps in; hyperdimensional geometry grows from space like vines. An abstracted avatar walks in. They write on a non-existent wall; G.O.D : THE GAME OF DREAMS

	- # "The Devil Asks Peter - what actually is 'Spirit'', and how can you prove that it exists?" 2023
	  
	  *Chongha Peter Lee spits blood on to the bare concrete gallery floor. He is strapped to a chair in a room lit by a single bulb. There is a green pentagram drawn on the floor around him. He is in the midst of an ancient ritual to bet his soul to the Devil to save the planet.* 
	  
	  He replies - "Devil, let me teach you a lesson".
	  
	  Here is what spirit can't possibly be:
	  1. Reduced to a particular individual product.
	  2. Reduced to a single functional process.
	  
	  What it could only possibly be:
	  1. The product of transindividuation, or synthesis ACROSS categories.
	  2. The process of autopoesis, or parts organizing into Emergent systems (or more accurately, Emergent systems self-organizing themselves through parts).
	  
	  *Chongha Peter Lee, tied to a chair, makes a gesture with his left hand, which alights with blue flame of the LogoMagick, the Conceptual branch of Coolcraft. Writ in this ethereal flame are citations of "Reza Negarestani : Intelligence and Spirit" and "Manuel De Landa: Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy". *
	  
	  My wager:
	  1. As spirit is a transindividual product - it must then be composed of a synthesis of affective AND conceptual AND perceptual dimensions.  
	  2. As spirit is evidenced in many things, such as humans and burning bushes and Miracles concerning fish and wine - it must then be composable across differing processes of individuation. 
	  
	  As for proof of the existence of spirit - if spirit did not exist, wouldn't all things in the universe be computable? 
	  
	  And if that was the case, would our situation not be so determined that I would not even be able to form this single countervailing question?
	  
	  *The Devil replies "Well played, Peter.... but there still remains the other legs of the wager. Let us see how you fare against more complexity. I will warn you, some of your predecessors were terminated in the following stages.*
	  
	  CHONGHA PETER LEE *(rapping, using PathosMagicks, the affective branch Coolcraft. As he raps, crimson lasers shoot from his mouth):*

	- ## "In his wager against the devil, Chongha Peter Lee calls upon Boris Groys and Reza Negarestani to redefine spirit, post-history and memory" 2023
	  
	  1. Spirit can be better redefined as the transductive autopoeisis, or emergence, of systems exteriorizing themselves probabilistically, which fits in line with Hegel's thought.
	  2. One of the biggest puzzles for both post-socialist and rampantly consumer societies is the puzzle of affect; this is not done through ideas of work, this is done through self-reflexive [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]ctice. The techne for this is in Eastern religions and particular bodily [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]xes and drugs and some parts of art.
	  3. Memory is simple; it is statistical constraints derived from quantum chemical computations in the body, many being subconscious. Hence, it is not that big of a deal. Imo, it is boring, tbh, unless it helps prevent disaster. Computers are great for reconfiguring memory. Post-history is stupid; what we need is statistical history of what COULD be, not a linear history.
	- # Contemporary Art Without "Contemporary"?
	  
	  Contemporary art is founded on the idea of "post-history", a constant march away from something stored in a past memory, or proposing ruptures in time, with archival materials from the past or speculative depictions of the future. There is a certain assumption that underlying all of the different images and interpretations, the viewer is always viewing from the SAME unified temporal stream of events in reality occurring in the "Present", or "Now", or "contemporariness" . 
	  
	  All events occur in the "contemporary moment", or a flow of "realtime", which is perceived as a continuous, fluid flow between the past and the future. Much of this mode of perception comes from the capacities of realtime media broadcasting.
	  
	  However, what if we simply just ditched this view of time and simply looked at times in terms of probability of events - a bit like an AI?
	  
	  Instead of simply ordering events from past to present to future - a probability based perspective would weight motions from one state to another. 
	  
	  Past, present and future would not order the events - functional capacities and affordances would direct the changes between system states- which is what AI does mechanically, opportunistically, based on a bunch of bizarre calculations from state to state.
	  
	  An image; in sports, say soccer - the ball does not move from past to present to future - it is propelled by multiple differing capacities and affordances, from player skill, to position on the field, to what someone ate that day. Every motion of the soccer ball, from one second to the next, is driven by many individual parts thinking about where the ball COULD be, and where the ball COULD, and also acting upon where it ACTUALLY is and the constraints of ACTUALLY scoring a goal.
	  
	  Not to say that this view should replace the paradigm of the present - but would it not benefit us to have multiple tools and modes to think about temporality? Why not? I would wager all the interesting effects would come from mixing, matching and imbibing temporal paradigms like metaphysical cocktails!
	- ## Why Get Hung Up on Realism and Why Not Engage in Reality Gaming?
	  
	  Here's my argument:
	  1. Realism requires a massive amount of philosophical and statistical skill to even talk about, let alone settle. There's like 10,000 people on Earth with this skill. There's no payout for proving it one way or another. (Which can be done).
	  2. Most of the people who don't believe in reality are of the 70% undereducated, or 29% specialists. Neither of these populations are equipped to non-violently argue out all the complexities of realism. Some of these people can't order a chicken sandwich without threatening to kill each other with knives. Specialists hate thinking unless they are drugged with something, which may include a chicken sandwich.
	  3. The fact is, the more inaccurate an individual is about their ideas of reality - the more open they are to executing bizarre experiments IN REALITY. Hence, while you may have reached for the Vodka after realizing 99% of people on the planet will never self-organize through intellectualism - now you are understanding that the entire planet is a massive playground - for reality games.
	- ## Why are all problems small and solvable to Mamasia,[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]Goddess of Gravity and Grace?
	  
	  Because she's the size of the Neo-Pangean[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]continent! From her perspective, every ecosocial problem of humanity is simply just a physical logistical problem.
	  
	  Also, she outsources much of her problem solving to [[Elan Semiotechne]], cloud startup CEO who is also a sentient cloud platform AND a physical cloud. He is full of a kajillion algorithms and philosophical musings, and eventually the right ones come together, like lightning streaking through a cloud!
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Would it not be better to simply build an outside position? 
	  
	  1. Contemporary art is dialectic logic, technophobia and an underdeveloped theoretical framework. Without intellectualism and skills, there is no remedy, it's just a circus of self-aware mediocrity.
	  
	  2. Popular culture is 17 year old adolescence, affect-driven zombiehood. We have 2 modes here - religious sincerity and nihilist immanence.
	  
	  3. Sciences are missing basic philosophy and are handcuffed by a startup paradigm; Humanities are handcuffed by various self-imposed stigmas.
	  
	  4. Tech is awash with idiots who can barely scrap together a single trivial new function, or an illiterate entrepreneur who can only make consumerware.
	  
	  An outside position would simply be synthesizing new inferences, and then pushing straight to press, recuperating its costs. It would not be entrapped in the singularities of any of these existing communities.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  4 unfixable cultures:
	  1. Pop culture is 17 year old sincerity and nihilism. (70%)
	  2. Tech is unimaginative, entrepreneurs push consumerware. (10%)
	  3. Contemporary art and media is techno-phobic, anti-intellectual self-aware mediocrity. (10%)
	  4. Sciences are handcuffed startups, Humanities are handcuffed nightclubs. (10%)
	  
	  The 1 thing uniting them:
	  Every event has higher or lower odds of occurrence and every claim has higher or lower degrees of accuracy.

	- # The Least Stupid Marketplace
	  
	  The Least Stupid marketplace, or a maximally inclusively scalable market doesn't yet exist, but could be connected together from existing parts. It would be comprised of planetary scale inclusively scalable goods and services. It's necessary to establish this optimal market so that existing markets can be compared and recombined in terms of strengths and weaknesses.
	  
	  Right now, there are only about 10,000 [[polymath]] individuals who could produce for such a market. But, they could connect networks of non-[[polymath]]s to participate in both the ideation and production. In fact, an inclusive pipeline would most likely be a requisite of any production in an inclusively scalable market.

	  üíØ, Devil. Why? Well it's for the very reason that we have people approaching art as a fashion and craft contest.
	  
	  These people are looking for something outside of the dreck of consumerism and specialist intellectualism; hence they engage in art because it's perceived as a space outside.
	  
	  Now, most do not have the skills to navigate at the highest levels.

	  1. Regulations of existing market stupidities and conflict resolution for existing conflicts.
	  2. Cyberwarfare pressures against the 1% to negotiate peace amongst public institutions and fulfill demands for post-work infrastructure and redistribution of wealth.

	  Steganographic DocumentaryEssay by [[Elan Semiotechne]] on the U.S.:
	  
	  1. How long will it take for the U.S. to stabilize? 30 to 40 years.
	  2. What is the best option for U.S. youth? Leave the U.S. go to Europe, get subsidized education. Come back as a consultant; get paid to fix it.
	  3. What to do with the leftover adult U.S. population? Nothing functional or artistic. Make bets for/against things, throw parties and give healthy drugs, go somewhere else! Teach only bright children, tell others to learn a trade, be happy.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  [[Elan Semiotechne]], speculative essay:
	  
	  For the U.S.: Healthy parties and drugs! Tell the smart kids to go to Europe for education; tell the rest to learn a trade and be happy by taking healthy drugs, not unhealthy drugs.
	  
	  Forget intellectualism, invention and revolution; it will take 30-40 years. Do that in France/Berlin!
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Artists can't do, talk, think, make or fight; they can sell and party.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  [[Elan Semiotechne]]'s Speculative Essay:
	  
	  Contemporary critical artists are so deskilled that they can only do 2 things:
	  
	  1. Drugs
	  2. Parties
	  
	  Never, ever, ever, ask them to make art.
