- An essay by the quantumdead Captain Amasia, as he works for the Grey Watch, a millions of years old organization which invisibly shapes the speculasphere of humanity to accelerate it towards neganthropy.

- 1. Beforehand, we can presume any cluster of speculations formed into a problem has a solution; we can also speculate that most humans don't have the philostatistical literacy to speculate accurately beforehand, particularly on yet-to-be defined options and outcomes. Also, even humans at peak capacity can only be accurate on about .0001% of possible speculations.

- 2. When humans encounter something novel, complex, and playfully interactive, they often respond by saying "this is fun!". This is when an experience fluidly synthesizes conceptually, perceptually and affectively, to operate with and without a human' intentions. 

- 3. When humans have fun, they tend to share things; however if something shared isn't critical and speculative, it typically is not worth it.

- 4. There is an utter cultural clusterf**k currently; elder generations hate tech and stick with old forms; Gen X lets their earnestness and intensity constrict art and invention; Gen Z is chemically imbalanced + going through a massive hormonal storm of the 20's.... this just leaves Gen Y with the skills and capacity to act.

- 5. So if the primary sell of Gen Y is the skills, then that should be the flag we wave as a rare group at this time; then to prove it, make art that is critical, speculative and playful for the people.
