- Presocial: Individuals, including non-humans, with and without power, who don't yet have the family of literacies and competencies to operate as autonomous, autodidactic, ethical agents in a given society.


- Presocial:  undereducated, deskilled and unethical positions in relation to the planet's subsystems.

- A presocial individual is any individual who doesn't have the competencies to operate in an inclusively scalable manner in relation to the Earth's subsystems. This translates to about 80-90% of existing societies are actually Presocial. This category transverses class. 

- Majority of today's cases of presocial individuals are produced by the trauma of neoliberalism, of whichever political camp, of whichever class category.

- There are varying degrees of risks of violence, fragility and entropy with presocial; this means that there are proportionate responses per case, many involving simply just providing time and space to think.

- For the most part, presociality is just a preliminary stage of an inclusively scalable evolutionary variance, which eventually leads to an inclusively scalable complexification of the planet.
