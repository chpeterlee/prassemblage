- # 1. Introduction
	- Underlying today's eco-social crises is systemic trauma which has reduced literacy of the planet's mechanics, both for those with and without power, stemming from neoliberal warfare and cuts to education and social services budgets.
	- The Cool School of Art situates itself in the context of 5th Generation Revolutionary theory, which defines today's ecosocial crises in terms of incapacitating organizational fragilities and unprecedented technological access.
	- ****More specifically, the Cool School connects' today's eco-social crises with systemic trauma from neoliberal warfare, cuts to education and social services budgets. This has drastically reduced literacy of the planet's mechanics, both for those with and without power, constraining our capacity to produce conflict solutions.

- # 2. Principles
	- **Process-first: **By reframing today's ecosocial crises as a lack of literacy, the process of learning is understood as a performative and feminist cosmopolitical protest and demand (a Learn-In). This is also referred to as [[invagination]] in nascent 5th wave Feminist theory which is constructed in relation to insights on systemic fragility provided by 5th Generation revolutionary theory.  
	  
	  An ongoing Steganographic Documentarytitled [[Birth of an Invagination - Until We Are Worth More Than Gold]], is being filmed in relation to the process.
	- **Outcomes: **The outcomes of this process of [[invagination]] is two-fold:
	  
	  A space for autodidactic phenomenology, complexity and philostatistics. This space can handle [[presocial]] populations through affective epistemological methods working with material culture (Ozan) as well as polymaths (Peter) producing playful media of complex concepts.
	  
	  The output is [[Hyperobjects]], sculpted from both physical and digital means which synthesize both material culture and informational cultures and invite viewers to engage in trans-disciplinary discussions.
