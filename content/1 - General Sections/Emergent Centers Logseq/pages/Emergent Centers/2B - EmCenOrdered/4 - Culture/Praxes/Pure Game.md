- Deleuze wrote a simple text in the Logic of Sense that defused all attempts at deduction and induction phrased in the form of a game.

- 1. The Pure Game takes place in a timespan faster than one can think.

- 2. Each time a turn is played in the Pure Game, the entire set of infinite outcomes and rules are cast anew - if simply affirms chance.

- 3. There is no winning or losing or attempt for advantage.

- 4. it is utter nonsense. The only thing that results is a work of art - that which resust irresolution.

- The core of this is being lifted and stuck into [[Game P: The Pure Game]] (a palindrome!)
