{:block/content "Kraft Docs.\n---\n\n\nIn the film [[Fragilicide.live - Map B]], Mr. [[Elan Semiotechne]] consults for a popular speculative horror film titled \"The Graywalker\" as a lovechaeologist and certified ontologist.\n\nThe film deals with the sudden appearance of a gray fog in all the media from the last 2 years of the pandemic. It comes and goes. People are not sure if it is actually a corruption of data, or an artifact of their declining cognitive skills and incapacity to perform accurate philosophical and statistical analyses.\n\nThere is less philosophical and statistical rigor than ever; organizations devolve into tribalism, conservativism and mysticism. People commit suicide for zero good reason, deteriorate democracy with utterly entropic messaging, and lock themselves into ivory towers, pursuing absolutely trivial research and being entrapped in inaccurate discourses.\n\nAmidst the chaos, people consult a man known only as \"The Graywalker\" to solve their dilemmas. He has the capability to actually travel into and through the gray fog in the media and data and exorcise the demons of entropy from a given body.\n\nHe is taking a series of Graywalking contracts to save up money to disappear permanently from society, only interfacing through art, fiction and games. \n\nWord on the street has it that he is an Alan Turing grade [[polymath]], who may know the answer to the universal equation and also has the schematics to the technology to cancel the apocalypse. \n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.

Hence it has intrinsic value, can easily be sold. \n\nAlso just simply ignore those who don't value it. Would be impossible to deal with em anyways.\n\nFor the masses: shrooms, not ideas!\n\n---\n$1, $5 Coffee, $20 Newspaper, $100 Artist/Aid, $1000 Entrepreneur/Activist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Bestideas.lol]] - a Web 4 horror film and Phd about making a possible horror film and PhD that could actually save the planet during the process of making it.\n\nBasic thesis and premise for the horror film: because there is no standardized planetary metrics of valuation and very few citizen philostatisticians, there is a high likelihood of planetary ecosocial collapse. If metrics did exist with a statistical majority of citizens capable of doing philostatistics, it would prevent collapse in 10 years and stop 12,000 children dying of preventable poverty per day.\n\nOf course, most modern humans are too traumatized to learn - their brain is fogged into incapacity. They see a fog, confuse projections for reality.\n\nSo a few survivors simply just make videos betting on ideas to send to philostatisticians to check.\n\nIn the movie is a Web 4 platform, a bit like a horserace track, where you bet on:\n1. What paradigm shift is weirder.\n2. Which paradigm shifts will save the planet faster than others."
