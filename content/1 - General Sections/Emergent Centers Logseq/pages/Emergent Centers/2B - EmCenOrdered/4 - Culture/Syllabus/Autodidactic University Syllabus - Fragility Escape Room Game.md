- What problem is this curriculum solving?
- Lack of capacity to accurately calculate and infer possibility and probability. 
  This is known as fragility which results in high likelihood of specialization, being exploited, debilitated civic infrastructure, and regional collapse.
	- Theoretical basis: The concept of the [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2B - EmCenOrdered/1 - Knowledge/Facts/Autodidactic Universe]] in which it is empirically proven that all components of the universe are comprised of quantum photons which self-organize into  relations of greater complexity over time. These organizations can either be circumstantially articulated as humans or non-humans. Hence, to modify what Antonio Gramsci said - "Every human (and non-human) is an intellectual).
	- There are 3 Levels:
	- **Level 1: Progressive Studio - for individual to small-group scale work (50% will fall into this).** Simply just playing with materials, beginning to understand how to produce more complex symbolic effects and being able to become self-aware of the separations between internal emotion, perceptual signal and the dynamics of material systems - and eventually transitioning to language-based conceptual art and poetry (Warhol, John Baldessari, Vito Acconci, Adrian Piper). (60% of a class).  **Here, people work in conversational pairs, but with independent goals, as in an artist residency.**
		- Memes & Performance
		- Video Lectures & Narrative Film
	- **Level 2: Social Arcade - for small group to city-scale work (30% will self-select)**. Playing with interpersonal contracts as mini-games. This is a media production, analysis and appropriation class. (20% of a class).  **People work in groups in a hackathon and open call format and mentor the Level 1.**
		- Books & Poetry
		- Analysis & Recombination
	- **Level 3: Autodidactic Casino (20% will self-select)** - for regional, multi-regional and planetary scale work. Peers: Forensic Architecture Group, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Otolith Group. Understanding the knowledge fields, technology, history, aesthetics, and wagering on different methods to construct possibilities and probabilities through human and non-human non-binary teams. People simply hold discussions and produce and present greypapers **and also mentor the Level 2.**
		- Research papers
		- Algorithm generation
		- Simulation generation
		- Analytic design & axiom phrasing
	- **Interface** - integrated between digital and physical. Also integrated curation and storefront, exhibition and broadcast and activism & arbitration pipeline.

Past and future planetary development of Amasia & some documentaries of the 15th Century Intercity Planetary intellectualism - contextualize subjectivity as the 7th Generation, current modern problems primarily from the trauma of the 1980's Reagan and Thatcher policies, and the current core division today of 1000 polymaths | populace, and division of labor as non-human | human.
