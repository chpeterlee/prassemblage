- 1.  Quantum Modernism is neither post modernism or modernism. It does not seek to produce a cultural framework based on linguistic concepts and selected historical cases. It does not produce a cultural framework - it simply aggregates a series of empirical physical facts which any possible cultural framework cannot ignore.
- 2. Quantum Modernism acknowledges the quantifiable difference in computational speed between quantum logic and classical logic; a quantum computer can compute in 200 seconds what it would take the world's largest classical supercomputer 10,000 years. In addition, all lands and nations are drifting into a neo-pangean supercontinent called Amasia.
- 3. Quantum Modernism is fundamentally based on the core principle of paradox underlying is fundamentally based on the core principle of paradox underlying quantum computing. This connects with many of the logical structures of older traditions and contemporary culture - such as Buddhist Koans, fictional experiments, Black Quantum Futurism, Superpositional Intersectionalism, and Mesoamerican metaphysics - seeing them simply as superpositional companions travelling through the adjacent possible. An adequate description is that classical logic sees the world as "True or False", Quantum Logic sees everything as "True and False".
- 4. Simultaneously, quantum modernism acknowledges the probabilistic nature of physical reality - and thus the limits of language, any given perceptual instrument and any given computational technology, including quantum computers. An adequate analogue is John Coltrane's systematic improvisation of probabilities that play upon the limits of human aural perception which are bounded by our 7 second short term memory loop, constructed in respect to the 30 km/s our planet is orbiting the sun, driven by a quantum chemical core generating an electro-magnetic field protecting us from the worst radiation, nested within a galaxy moving 600 km/s through the universe.
- 5. Quantum Modernism recognizes that all probabilities and possibilities are locked to a universal balancing mechanism distributed through every quantum particle in the universe. If this was not true, an accidental spin would have triggered a collapse of the universe at light speed. The continued visiblity of light proves that the universal balancing mechanism is still functioning.
