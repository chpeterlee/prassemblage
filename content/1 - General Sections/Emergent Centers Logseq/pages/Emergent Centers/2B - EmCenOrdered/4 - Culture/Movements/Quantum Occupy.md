- Quantum Occupy uses quantum-aware tactics of organizing based on the fundamental mechanic of [[Quantum Datasets]]. As each point of information and physical reality exists in a superpositional state of potential multiplicity which resolves probability - aspects of individuals and information comprising social groups can be deduced through a probabilistic computation of what is and what is not evident. Thus, any existing dataset, metric or goal can be quantum-balanced to a state of potential multiplicity.
