- What is the [[A.S.S. Saving Economy]]?

- The [[A.S.S. Saving Economy]] is the Amasian Speculative Supranational economy, in which various entities work at the breaking points of new crises.

- Clearly, the planet is so fragile in that it only has the E.U. as a single supranational governmental body. A supranational governmental body is  an organization that transcends the law of any single nation-state.

- Effective planetary coordination organizations do not exist; everything is done ad-hoc, from relief efforts to warfare. Hence why there is so much trans-national conflict, incompetence and exploitation. Until an effective planetary self-regulatory apparatus is built, this will continue, and as such, a job in the [[A.S.S. Saving Economy]] is the safest possible job one could have.

- The A.S.S saving economy is a speculative art project based on the premise that eventually, an effective supranational governmental body will emerge in the future, based on the supercontinent of Amasia.

- Until that time, various research bodies using the [[SRP]] or [[Statistical Review Protocol]] have determined that tiered grass-roots efforts in conjunction with municipality level coordination is the most effective strategy for regional scale triage.
