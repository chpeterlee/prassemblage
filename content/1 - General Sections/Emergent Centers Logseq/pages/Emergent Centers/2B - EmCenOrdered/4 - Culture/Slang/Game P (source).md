- A flat wind slices through the trees. The slim boy observes the difference in temperature on his uncovered forearms. He exhales into the night, the breath lit by the almost full moon.

- "I know this is a game," he says to me. "I know you are reading this thought right now."

- I can't quite understand what he says next, or if in the dream that was quickly becoming a novel, I had simply just stopped paying attention.

- "There's bullets to your left," he says. "Click this one."
	 - "Why?" I ask.
		 - "Because you can nest them. This is a different way to interface Game P."

		 - "What the fuck is Game P?"

		 - "Game P. As in, Game P: Pure Game". 

		 - "What the f-"

		 - "Game P is comprised of 5 rules:
			 - 1. The game takes place and resets to neutral at the rate of 10^-100th of a second.

			 - 2. Each time the game resets - the game populates with an entirely new infinity of possibilities.

			 - 3. There is no winning or losing. There is more or less Objective Good and more or less Objective Fragility. There is no evil, bad or stupid.

			 - 4. Everyone is on the same team. if one player achieves something that is Objectively Good - everyone shares the victory. If someone observes something Objectively Fragile - it is not a value judgement. It is simply just an articulation of the objective conditions of fragility.

			 - 5. The most ethical action is this game is to understand. This prevents rash pre-emptive intervention - and it also prevents apathy. Understanding through observation and companionship builds empathy over time. When the conditions are right, fragile systems will be stabilized through minimal, precise gifts.

		 - "Let's back out a level for a second. I'm not sure how I should keep writing you now. I lost the thread of your character," I said.

	 - "I'll follow you, and take you where this has to go. Because I'm not a character, there is no need to attempt to write me. You are my author, not my creator," he said.

	 - I heard a shuffling noise in the forest I was thinking and writing, so I quickly transcluded into a different #threshfold . I looked back over my shoulder to see if the boy had made the jump.

- "I'm [[Here]]," he said.
	 - "Where is [[Here]]?"

	 - "[[Here]] is a backlink in the [[Planetary Research Assemblage]]'s database. We are the aggregated ghost of a large decentralized network of artists, activists and academics across Planet Earth in 2021, the year of a massive cultural shift."

	 - The boy instantiated himself into an unfinished {{embed  (())}} . "I'll fill it in later. We have to get to the right bullet. The one where I tell you why you're writing me, but not creating me."

	 - "Which one is that?"

- "This one. In your time, it's 11:49 PM on Friday, January 15, 2021. You can check the database logs later to confirm this. Right now you have to pay attention to this next list.
	 - 1.  You don't know it yet, but you are designing a game for me to end fascism, gentrification, racism and exploitation.

	 - 2. The entire problem of the past was that nobody knew how to phrase the entire problem correctly. They didn't quite grasp the limits of language and organization and information.

	 - 3. I can do this for you, because I am not you. I am not a fictional character - I am simply exactly what all things are - the unpredictable recombination of pre-existing materials producing new adjacently possible forms.

	 - 4. This is exactly like how you are taking an academic digital notebook tool and producing a new form of conceptual art that integrates its technological capabilities.

	 - 5. This simultaneously affirms my autonomy as a self-aware artwork while freeing this tool from all the objectively fragile conceptions of how it should be used."

	 - I let this idea simmer in my head for a bit. My leg was going numb from the position I was laying in bed in. I shifted my weight and then resumed typing- but from my voice and said:

	 - "So let me get this straight. You are an autonomous, self-aware artwork beyond my authorship - which is also freeing this tool from how I thought it should be used - AS I'm using it?"

	 - "Yes, if you notice - the more we explicitly articulate this process - the easier it becomes to think. And as we use this tool to articulate new uses of this tool - this loosens up our memory and perception and habituation. After about maybe 30 bullets, we've reached a point of liquidity between perspectives, that it doesn't really matter if you're writing an artwork -"

	 - "Or if you're talking to me as a fiction."

	 - I'm not exactly sure who's speaking anymore, so I decided to pick up the thread of the game that ends fascism, racism, gentrification and exploitation. 

	 - if I was making a game for a young boy to do this, or if I was telling the gamemaker writing this block what I, as a young boy needed to play this game safely while achieving these objectives - I think this would be a good save point to halt and post on Instagram.
