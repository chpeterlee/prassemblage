	 - 1. All of objectively physical reality, composed of matter, energy and information - is objectively provable to be ultimately indefinite and incalculable.

	 - 2. The adjacent possibilities of something as small as a protein, exceed the computational capacity of an impossible to actually build but possible to think - quantum chemical computer the size of the planet. Basically - we can compute like .000000001% of the possibilities of objective physical reality at any given waking moment, even with the most advanced possible technology.

	 - 3. All conceptual systems are subsystems of dealing with this fact. Both symbols and physical systems are circumstantially useful in diagramming limited objective aspects of physical systems and can be said to compute "more or less" adjacent possibilities in relation to each other. 

	 - 4. Any given instance of "theory" or "practice" or "computation" or "art" is always in relation to the objectively provable fact of indefinition and incalculability.

	 - 5. Particular theories or practice s can be disassembled and recombined like toys and games in order to pleasantly surf objective indefinition and incalculability creatively. Utilizing matter, energy and information for theory, practice , computation and art can all be lumped into the general activity of: recombining universal quantum chemical assemblages to unpredictably produce new byproducts. This means thinking, pooping, painting and theorizing are objectively the same value, the byproducts can be said to be "more or less interesting in relation to an objective good that can't be fully computed by an Earth-size quantum computer - but can be ballparked with some pen, paper and coffee and good search engines and stupid comments. (which, if you look in the history of mathematics - is actually how new world changing ideas are formed. You sit at a table with coffee and friends and pieces of paper and bullshit.)
