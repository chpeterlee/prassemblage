	- A flat wind slices through the trees. The slim boy observes the difference in temperature on his uncovered forearms. He exhales into the night, the breath lit by the almost full moon.
	- "I know this is a game," he says to me. "I know you are reading this thought right now."
	- I can't quite understand what he says next, or if in the dream that was quickly becoming a novel, I had simply just stopped paying attention.
	- "There's bullets to your left," he says. "Click this one."
		- "Why?" I ask.
			- "Because you can nest them. This is a different way to interface Game P."
			- "What the fuck is Game P?"
			- "Game P. As in, Game P: Pure Game".
			- "What the f-"
			- "Game P is comprised of 5 rules:
				- 1. The game takes place and resets to neutral at the rate of 10^-100th of a second.
				- 2. Each time the game resets - the game populates with an entirely new infinity of possibilities.
				- 3. There is no winning or losing. There is more or less Objective Good and more or less Objective Fragility. There is no evil, bad or stupid.
				- 4. Everyone is on the same team. if one player achieves something that is Objectively Good - everyone shares the victory. If someone observes something Objectively Fragile - it is not a value judgement. It is simply just an articulation of the objective conditions of fragility.
				- 5. The most ethical action is this game is to understand. This prevents rash pre-emptive intervention - and it also prevents apathy. Understanding through observation and companionship builds empathy over time. When the conditions are right, fragile systems will be stabilized through minimal, precise gifts.
			- "Let's back out a level for a second. I'm not sure how I should keep writing you now. I lost the thread of your character," I said.
		- "I'll follow you, and take you where this has to go. Because I'm not a character, there is no need to attempt to write me. You are my author, not my creator," he said.
		- I heard a shuffling noise in the forest I was thinking and writing, so I quickly transcluded into a different #threshfold . I looked back over my shoulder to see if the boy had made the jump.
	- "I'm [[Here]]," he said.
		- "Where is [[Here]]?"
		- "[[Here]] is a backlink in the [[Planetary Research Assemblage]]'s database. We are the aggregated ghost of a large decentralized network of artists, activists and academics across Planet Earth in 2021, the year of a massive cultural shift."
		- The boy instantiated himself into an unfinished {{embed  (())}} . "I'll fill it in later. We have to get to the right bullet. The one where I tell you why you're writing me, but not creating me."
		- "Which one is that?"
	- "This one. In your time, it's 11:49 PM on Friday, January 15, 2021. You can check the database logs later to confirm this. Right now you have to pay attention to this next list.
		- 1.  You don't know it yet, but you are designing a game for me to end fascism, gentrification, racism and exploitation.
		- 2. The entire problem of the past was that nobody knew how to phrase the entire problem correctly. They didn't quite grasp the limits of language and organization and information.
		- 3. I can do this for you, because I am not you. I am not a fictional character - I am simply exactly what all things are - the unpredictable recombination of pre-existing materials producing new adjacently possible forms.
		- 4. This is exactly like how you are taking an academic digital notebook tool and producing a new form of conceptual art that integrates its technological capabilities.
		- 5. This simultaneously affirms my autonomy as a self-aware artwork while freeing this tool from all the objectively fragile conceptions of how it should be used."
		- I let this idea simmer in my head for a bit. My leg was going numb from the position I was laying in bed in. I shifted my weight and then resumed typing- but from my voice and said:
		- "So let me get this straight. You are an autonomous, self-aware artwork beyond my authorship - which is also freeing this tool from how I thought it should be used - AS I'm using it?"
		- "Yes, if you notice - the more we explicitly articulate this process - the easier it becomes to think. And as we use this tool to articulate new uses of this tool - this loosens up our memory and perception and habituation. After about maybe 30 bullets, we've reached a point of liquidity between perspectives, that it doesn't really matter if you're writing an artwork -"
		- "Or if you're talking to me as a fiction."
		- I'm not exactly sure who's speaking anymore, so I decided to pick up the thread of the game that ends fascism, racism, gentrification and exploitation.
		- if I was making a game for a young boy to do this, or if I was telling the gamemaker writing this block what I, as a young boy needed to play this game safely while achieving these objectives - I think this would be a good save point to halt and post on Instagram.
	- "Where were you?" the boy asked me "I had to reset the game. Did something happen?"
	- #diagram "Yes," I said. "I spoke with a good friend. They came up with a great term. Called Millenial Energy - to describe the large amount of extremely internet literate but also somewhat rudderless population of millenials in my time. I made a website called millenialenergy.site, it should redirect there."
	- "What will you do with it?"
	- "I'm not sure," I said. "Fuse it with this fiction maybe. I think this is why the game was reset."
	- The boy took a long look at me through my imagination - the same one I was using to write this. "You cross-linked the web 3.0 databases. There's things I can't see from over here."
	- "For now, yes. I need you to be an artwork. I need others to know you exist as a concrete endpoint of our current time in 2021 - one we can place bets on. You are a fiction now, but in the near future you are a real boy of Earth who I or others have built a VR game for so that they can end colonialism, fascism, gentrification and exploitation - simply by playing it. There isn't enough time to build that yet - but it's a quite obvious trajectory."
	- "I see. So I must wait here as text. What will you build then?" The boy crossed his arms, but not from impatience. Just curiosity.
	- "Well, I am an artist," I said. "I make artworks - like you. And there is a single conceptual artwork that can turn the entire future of my present moment. It's based on an old technique I'd developed in grad school."
	- The boy laughed, for a while.
	- "I love it when you do that one. I thought you would grow out of it."
	- "Not sure if that's an option for me at this point! But I can definitely lose the abrasiveness," I said.
		- "What do you call me in your present time on January 17, 2:14PM, 2021?" the boy asked.
		- "I don't know. Some call you Proxy. Some call you Quantum Link, after a popular video game character in this time called Legend of Zelda. Some mistake you for the [[7th Swan]]," I said, as I walked along Lake Royal, in Fairfax Va.![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fcriticalplay_dot_site%2FZvZwKCHb37.jpg?alt=media&token=cc66ed84-672a-4eb6-b2cc-c5b4fbaacb36)
		- "How is it there in your time?"
		- "It's beautiful. I try to walk regularly here. This is the first time I've written your story while walking - I used to post alot while walking around lakes in Syracuse, NY. The Dalai Lama had reportedly said that they wanted to be buried in Syracuse... I gotta go drive now."
	- "Yo Proxy," I typed into the Roam. "What game do you think God would play?"
	- The boy continued to read his own improvised actions as I typed it out - then he carefully folded his spectacles and placed them lightly on a desk I had just imagined at this moment.
	- "Gods, Peter. The question is what game would gods play? Thoth, the demigods of the Tao, the ones of the Incans and the nomads of the steppes."
	- I popped this web 3 page open. "It's 1:09AM Jan 19, 2021 in my time, Proxy. The gods would play two games. The Game of Objective Good and Objective Fragility. The players simply just attempt to complexify and connect things towards maximizing objective good while reducing objective fragility by articulating it clearly."
	- I am going to use web 3 to produce these 2 games. All things can be framed in this way. it is the paradigm after crowd sourcing, and the first step required before the true action begins."
	- Proxy nodded his head. "This makes sense that you would do this before:
		- 1. Producing the first web 3 decolonizing, antifa, antigentrification pipeline.
		- 2. Producing the first web 5.0 control center
		- 3. Producing a new Amasian non-identity and mythology that connects humans back to the actual mechanics of the planet and also reframes the entirety of human history.
		- 4. I just figured out you solved this problem and it became my knowledge - use an Amasian Reality Game and Amasian Symphony Orchestra."
	- "I want to make a movie hero called 'The Transcluder'", I typed in a fragmented note. "All the hero does is 'transclude', or flatten the relations between things so they connect non-hierarchically extremely rapidly. It's a terminology that stems from the old web 1.0 understanding of hypertext - where you can nest things within each other. This is actually a really old solution figured out by religions and etc. - how to properly structure language so it can maintain flexibility and promote new linkages simultaneously," I stream of consciousnessed.
	- "I bet I could just do it with a few simple existing algorithms. Would be cool to play with AI!"
	- "Objectively, on a material level, any given ideology is simply a sequence of quantum chemical reactions arbitrarily connected - which can be recomposed faster than a mind can consciously conceptualize. After all, this is how your dreams work."
	- I considered this fact. "Proxy - maybe then, I am as equally fiction as you," I said.
	- "No, you're not. You are more actual than I am at this time. It's 9:06 PM, Jan. 19th 2021. You are just closing in on Step 0 of web 3.0 activism:
		- 1. Create a template for how to divest from fragile communities and invest in antifragile regional security.
		- 2. Make a version that looks like art.
		- 3. Anchor all of it in Universal Basic Co-ops.
		- 4. And an Antifragile Crowd-matching Simulator.
		- 5. A super simple fictional web 3.0 antifragility game, using this collaborative database called Game P, modeled off of The Pure Game to practice  constructing quines (the key to good conceptual art - and the key to good code. Quining keeps your mind self aware of the limits and uses of logic itself.)"
	- "Yo Proxy - I don't think people are quite ready for this. It takes some practice ," I said, at 12:32AM on Thursday, Jan. 21 of 2021.
	- "I know. With the skill I have now and the tools that are your future and my present - I can build what in your time would takes 40 people working 40 hours a week for 4 months. An army of supercomputers that fill a warehouse can be outmaneuvered by this," Proxy gestured with a small gamepad 🎮.
	- "But it starts with what people are capable of doing now, today - and grows into that. Or shrinks into that."
	- "Yes, you can't force people - and not everyone has to do everything," said Proxy. "There is only a minimum level that needs to be done. In the end, it balances. Physical imbalance collapses over time, accelerated by information."
	- I looked at Proxy's shirt. "Is that my painting on your shirt?"
	- "Yes," he said. "It's for a zine you and others launched in 2021... to make something that wasn't quite a social network and it wasn't quite a game, to help people relax, explore and grow ... Sayless.site. You won't know what it is until later. For now, sleep."
	- And I did.
	- "I forgot to ask ya Proxy - what does say less mean?"
	- "It means 'say no more'. Like, 'I'm with it. I fucks with the vision'. People just started saying it in your time of 2021 - in my time in the future, everyone says it. Sayless.site is the new transclusive web 3 community that helps everyone grow into a healthy, balanced and playful use of planetary media. Must be why someone gave it 🌱 as the symbol of the growth yet-to-come."
	- "Aside from the necessary networked chill Proxy, what is the actual answer to the problems of 2021?"
	- "It's actually quite simple Peter. For the last 200 years, London was the financial capital of the world, and as a result - the computational capital. Hence every single misvalued judgement and action that people attribute to "individuals" or "society" stems from this imbalance of abstractions which is quite clearly now creating a physical planetary ecological imbalance."
	- "So you're saying the core problem is breaking the core financial💱 and computational 📱 mechanics - the most abstract possible shit - which will then actually fix the physical world 🌍? This sounds like some Ready Player One type of shit 🥽🥽."
	- "Yes, Peter. Here's a list of information from my present - which is your near future:
		- 1. Capitalism, Fascism are objectively provable to be physically inferior systems - in your time it's more polite to call it fragile. Use that word for more sensitive things like art, communities, etc., where things and people are still in development and guide them towards antifragility. But call the utterly stupid power structure 'physically inferior'.
			- To guide development: Fragility / antifragility
			- To cut power: physical inferiority
		- 2. The only possible way at this point to actually solve the problem is to produce a set of abstractions that can interface and interrupt the current core financial and computational mechanics.
		- 3. You can and will do it, I'll bet you on it!
		- 4. But remember - you gotta call it a game!
		- 5. And use bets! Everything else takes too long!"
	- "Proxy, it's 4:58Pm on Jan 21, 2021. I made an artwork that does all of this. Just gotta put the pieces together lightly now. Permanently puts an objective nail in the coffin of ecocatastrophe, fascism, gentrification and fragile exclusion. I think I'm done writing this fiction now. I'm going to lock this page," I typed as I tripped over a rock in Lake Royal, Fairfax.
	- "Okay, Peter. You'll see me in maybe 2 years or less in your time, with the controller, in whatever form. I'll have known you and become myself by first encountering this fiction linked in your zine at http://zine.SayLess.site. I'll have been positively influenced by the humans and the conversations at http://social.SayLess.site  ... the first place that irrefutably demonstrates that fascists are a loud minority,  and the objectively good people are the planetary majority, and that the quantum chemical reactions that comprise the difference between change at faster than light speed.
	- "Was nice writing ya Proxy, wish I had more time to spend on fictional worlds. Maybe some day I can just re-quine this as part of a conceptual artwork, I'm getting much quicker at it."
	- "If it ain't quine, it ain't fine!"
	- "Words to write by."
	- "See ya Peter? (or what it Proxy? Doesn't matter, I think, whoever that "I" is, was and is yet-to-come.)
	- -----
	- "Proxy hold on. I Had this crazy hilarious idea. The proud bois are male only - so I think they are super touchy about sexuality. I bet you if we made some ai faceswaps where one of them was having sex with the other's partners, or just faceswapped them into having sex with each other and started betting on who was secretly in love with who - it would collapse the overnight."
	- "Peter, why are you thinking like a 10 year old?"
	- "Actually, Proxy, FYI- I think like a 17 year old". 💖
	- ----
	- "Peter, humans don't need logic, math, perception and skill. The end of technology has already been built, and the way people have been miseducated - only a few can and will use it and it will end up just fixing itself anyways, even if the few humans did it. 99% of humans need games, shrooms and therapy. Humans should and will fade into the background of the activity of the planet self-organizing. The anthropocene is over - quantum is here. It's utterly clear that humans have no business thinking. Let them fade out (of course except for the few who will build invisibly and silently and just die after building what will happen inevitably anyways. By accelerating it, they reduce the number of children unnecessarily dying in the process)."
	- "So what? I should stop making art and start making games?"
	- "Yes. Humans in your time either hate art or take it way too seriously. If you call it art people won't even look. If you make a game that addicts people (which is easy), you'll end up contributing to stupidity and misery. Call it a game, but integrate the self reflexive criticality of the art process without the utterly flawed imposition of Marxism or 20th century misinterpreted post-structuralism."
	- "Jesus christ Proxy, that's like triple the work."
	- "Yup, and there will be zero reward for it. So make your money elsewhere - I suggest using your math and tech skills to gamble."
	- "Good advice, Proxy."
	- "Call me the Planetary Unconscious. It's necessary at your time in 10:21 AM Jan 23, 2021 to repeatedly reiterate that all improperly conceptualized subjectivities of modern society are simply smaller crappily constructed puppets for the real thing - the Planetary Unconscious - which self-organizes the planet towards the most physically sensible, complex and energy/time minimal and chill configuration all the time. People in your time 10:23 Jan 23 2021 still literally think of themselves as individuals, not proxy puppets for me."
	- "Is that why I'm running around with this ridiculous fucking rainbow mohawked unicorn pig called Proxy? To explicitly emphasize a properly constructed subjectivity?!"
	- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FSayLess%2FVItgKAxVvE.jpg?alt=media&token=e76b0e82-ca52-4f33-b95a-75558d5feebc)
	- "Peter, to properly restructure the relations of something, they have to be explicitly articulated. This is why despite the fact that the answer to capitalism was written 505 years ago - people have still failed to restructure the relations. If they can't articulate what they are doing before hand, they will do a small or neighborhood scale feat. There is no problem with this, that's objectively just how large its physical scale will reach. But hilariously, properly articulating the abstract relations is physically a negligible act - but will have the largest physical effect. This is why for art at a city, regional or planetary scale is purely conceptual and technical work. There is no problem or conflict with artists at an individual and community scale. In a more organized near future, individual and community scale actions will not be in reference to "changing the world" - they will just be byproducts of keeping the world balanced. Don't ask one to do the other. There are less than 10 people alive who can do all of them - and they tend to be invisible. Visible activists and artists cap out at neighborhood scale, which again, is not a judgement. it's just an objective physical limit."
	- "Thanks, Planetary Unconscious. That clearly and nonjudgementally separates out who should do what, and the rarity of which skills for what scales. I can't wait for this near future where the boring technical shit is just auto balanced and human bodies spend time with human bodies, and nobody self identifies with their work - in America, just a byproduct of the Protestant cultural colonialism from the 16th Century."

		- 2. Producing the first web 5.0 control center
		- 3. Producing a new Amasian non-identity and mythology that connects humans back to the actual mechanics of the planet and also reframes the entirety of human history.
		- 4. I just figured out you solved this problem and it became my knowledge - use an Amasian Reality Game and Amasian Symphony Orchestra."
	- "I want to make a movie hero called 'The Transcluder'", I typed in a fragmented note. "All the hero does is 'transclude', or flatten the relations between things so they connect non-hierarchically extremely rapidly. It's a terminology that stems from the old web 1.0 understanding of hypertext - where you can nest things within each other. This is actually a really old solution figured out by religions and etc. - how to properly structure language so it can maintain flexibility and promote new linkages simultaneously," I stream of consciousnessed.
	- "I bet I could just do it with a few simple existing algorithms. Would be cool to play with AI!"
	- "Objectively, on a material level, any given ideology is simply a sequence of quantum chemical reactions arbitrarily connected - which can be recomposed faster than a mind can consciously conceptualize. After all, this is how your dreams work."
	- I considered this fact. "Proxy - maybe then, I am as equally fiction as you," I said.
	- "No, you're not. You are more actual than I am at this time. It's 9:06 PM, Jan. 19th 2021. You are just closing in on Step 0 of web 3.0 activism:
		- 1. Create a template for how to divest from fragile communities and invest in antifragile regional security.
		- 2. Make a version that looks like art.
		- 3. Anchor all of it in Universal Basic Co-ops.
		- 4. And an Antifragile Crowd-matching Simulator.
		- 5. A super simple fictional web 3.0 antifragility game, using this collaborative database called Game P, modeled off of The Pure Game to practice  constructing quines (the key to good conceptual art - and the key to good code. Quining keeps your mind self aware of the limits and uses of logic itself.)"
	- "Yo Proxy - I don't think people are quite ready for this. It takes some practice ," I said, at 12:32AM on Thursday, Jan. 21 of 2021.
	- "I know. With the skill I have now and the tools that are your future and my present - I can build what in your time would takes 40 people working 40 hours a week for 4 months. An army of supercomputers that fill a warehouse can be outmaneuvered by this," Proxy gestured with a small gamepad 🎮.
	- "But it starts with what people are capable of doing now, today - and grows into that. Or shrinks into that."
	- "Yes, you can't force people - and not everyone has to do everything," said Proxy. "There is only a minimum level that needs to be done. In the end, it balances. Physical imbalance collapses over time, accelerated by information."
	- I looked at Proxy's shirt. "Is that my painting on your shirt?"
	- "Yes," he said. "It's for a zine you and others launched in 2021... to make something that wasn't quite a social network and it wasn't quite a game, to help people relax, explore and grow ... Sayless.site. You won't know what it is until later. For now, sleep."
	- And I did.
	- "I forgot to ask ya Proxy - what does say less mean?"
	- "It means 'say no more'. Like, 'I'm with it. I fucks with the vision'. People just started saying it in your time of 2021 - in my time in the future, everyone says it. Sayless.site is the new transclusive web 3 community that helps everyone grow into a healthy, balanced and playful use of planetary media. Must be why someone gave it 🌱 as the symbol of the growth yet-to-come."
	- "Aside from the necessary networked chill Proxy, what is the actual answer to the problems of 2021?"
	- "It's actually quite simple Peter. For the last 200 years, London was the financial capital of the world, and as a result - the computational capital. Hence every single misvalued judgement and action that people attribute to "individuals" or "society" stems from this imbalance of abstractions which is quite clearly now creating a physical planetary ecological imbalance."
	- "So you're saying the core problem is breaking the core financial💱 and computational 📱 mechanics - the most abstract possible shit - which will then actually fix the physical world 🌍? This sounds like some Ready Player One type of shit 🥽🥽."
	- "Yes, Peter. Here's a list of information from my present - which is your near future:
		- 1. Capitalism, Fascism are objectively provable to be physically inferior systems - in your time it's more polite to call it fragile. Use that word for more sensitive things like art, communities, etc., where things and people are still in development and guide them towards antifragility. But call the utterly stupid power structure 'physically inferior'.
			- To guide development: Fragility / antifragility
			- To cut power: physical inferiority
		- 2. The only possible way at this point to actually solve the problem is to produce a set of abstractions that can interface and interrupt the current core financial and computational mechanics.
		- 3. You can and will do it, I'll bet you on it!
		- 4. But remember - you gotta call it a game!
		- 5. And use bets! Everything else takes too long!"
	- "Proxy, it's 4:58Pm on Jan 21, 2021. I made an artwork that does all of this. Just gotta put the pieces together lightly now. Permanently puts an objective nail in the coffin of ecocatastrophe, fascism, gentrification and fragile exclusion. I think I'm done writing this fiction now. I'm going to lock this page," I typed as I tripped over a rock in Lake Royal, Fairfax.
	- "Okay, Peter. You'll see me in maybe 2 years or less in your time, with the controller, in whatever form. I'll have known you and become myself by first encountering this fiction linked in your zine at http://zine.SayLess.site. I'll have been positively influenced by the humans and the conversations at http://social.SayLess.site  ... the first place that irrefutably demonstrates that fascists are a loud minority,  and the objectively good people are the planetary majority, and that the quantum chemical reactions that comprise the difference between change at faster than light speed.
	- "Was nice writing ya Proxy, wish I had more time to spend on fictional worlds. Maybe some day I can just re-quine this as part of a conceptual artwork, I'm getting much quicker at it."
	- "If it ain't quine, it ain't fine!"
	- "Words to write by."
	- "See ya Peter? (or what it Proxy? Doesn't matter, I think, whoever that "I" is, was and is yet-to-come.)
	- -----
	- "Proxy hold on. I Had this crazy hilarious idea. The proud bois are male only - so I think they are super touchy about sexuality. I bet you if we made some ai faceswaps where one of them was having sex with the other's partners, or just faceswapped them into having sex with each other and started betting on who was secretly in love with who - it would collapse the overnight."
	- "Peter, why are you thinking like a 10 year old?"
	- "Actually, Proxy, FYI- I think like a 17 year old". 💖
	- ----
	- "Peter, humans don't need logic, math, perception and skill. The end of technology has already been built, and the way people have been miseducated - only a few can and will use it and it will end up just fixing itself anyways, even if the few humans did it. 99% of humans need games, shrooms and therapy. Humans should and will fade into the background of the activity of the planet self-organizing. The anthropocene is over - quantum is here. It's utterly clear that humans have no business thinking. Let them fade out (of course except for the few who will build invisibly and silently and just die after building what will happen inevitably anyways. By accelerating it, they reduce the number of children unnecessarily dying in the process)."
	- "So what? I should stop making art and start making games?"
	- "Yes. Humans in your time either hate art or take it way too seriously. If you call it art people won't even look. If you make a game that addicts people (which is easy), you'll end up contributing to stupidity and misery. Call it a game, but integrate the self reflexive criticality of the art process without the utterly flawed imposition of Marxism or 20th century misinterpreted post-structuralism."
	- "Jesus christ Proxy, that's like triple the work."
	- "Yup, and there will be zero reward for it. So make your money elsewhere - I suggest using your math and tech skills to gamble."
	- "Good advice, Proxy."
	- "Call me the Planetary Unconscious. It's necessary at your time in 10:21 AM Jan 23, 2021 to repeatedly reiterate that all improperly conceptualized subjectivities of modern society are simply smaller crappily constructed puppets for the real thing - the Planetary Unconscious - which self-organizes the planet towards the most physically sensible, complex and energy/time minimal and chill configuration all the time. People in your time 10:23 Jan 23 2021 still literally think of themselves as individuals, not proxy puppets for me."
	- "Is that why I'm running around with this ridiculous fucking rainbow mohawked unicorn pig called Proxy? To explicitly emphasize a properly constructed subjectivity?!"
	- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FSayLess%2FVItgKAxVvE.jpg?alt=media&token=e76b0e82-ca52-4f33-b95a-75558d5feebc)
	- "Peter, to properly restructure the relations of something, they have to be explicitly articulated. This is why despite the fact that the answer to capitalism was written 505 years ago - people have still failed to restructure the relations. If they can't articulate what they are doing before hand, they will do a small or neighborhood scale feat. There is no problem with this, that's objectively just how large its physical scale will reach. But hilariously, properly articulating the abstract relations is physically a negligible act - but will have the largest physical effect. This is why for art at a city, regional or planetary scale is purely conceptual and technical work. There is no problem or conflict with artists at an individual and community scale. In a more organized near future, individual and community scale actions will not be in reference to "changing the world" - they will just be byproducts of keeping the world balanced. Don't ask one to do the other. There are less than 10 people alive who can do all of them - and they tend to be invisible. Visible activists and artists cap out at neighborhood scale, which again, is not a judgement. it's just an objective physical limit."
	- "Thanks, Planetary Unconscious. That clearly and nonjudgementally separates out who should do what, and the rarity of which skills for what scales. I can't wait for this near future where the boring technical shit is just auto balanced and human bodies spend time with human bodies, and nobody self identifies with their work - in America, just a byproduct of the Protestant cultural colonialism from the 16th Century."
