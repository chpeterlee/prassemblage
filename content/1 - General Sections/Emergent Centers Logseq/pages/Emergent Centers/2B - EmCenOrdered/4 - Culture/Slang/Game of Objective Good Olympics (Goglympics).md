- 1. Main Description--------
	 - We are all on the same team understanding, articulating and mediating the Objectively Fragile - not each other, not evil, not bad and not stupidity. Hence it is a non- judgemental competitive non-competition.

	 - When we achieve a small or large objective good - we share the victory universally. When a small or large objective fragility occurs - it is compartmentalized in time and scale and can be dynamically balanced over time through understanding, articulation and mediation.

	 - Objective Good victories, because we are on the same team, are universally shared. However we can talk about the specifics of spatial scale, the time scale and the emergent effects.

	 - Talking about these specifics does not negate the fact that the objective good is objectively good and universally shared, whether small or large. In fact, contrary to popular belief - the good should be so well analyzed that people understand how it works so that it is tested and verified at larger scales. So it becomes first a distributed skill and tool, and then an automated reflex or system.

	 - When the good becomes automated - then it pre-emptively prevents the fragile. Just like how I can now pull my pants down before I poop without thinking - thus I automatically keep myself from doing the objectively fragile thing of pooping my pants 1 to 2 times a day.

	 - The Game of Objective Good resets to zero at 10^-100th of a second, producing 10^100 new possibilities by recombining existing assemblages of quantum chemistry.

	 - Due to the massive amount of computation required to consistently compute and articulate the Objective Good as best as possible- simulations are often used as a tool to rapidly understand the dynamics of large probabilistic systems.

	 - The primary ethical action in the game of objective good is understanding. Understanding produces empathy which produces precise and minimal action towards the objective good- which produces more understanding.

	 - Artists today use simulation as a medium to integrate across media and construct plausible speculations and speculate on possibilities.
