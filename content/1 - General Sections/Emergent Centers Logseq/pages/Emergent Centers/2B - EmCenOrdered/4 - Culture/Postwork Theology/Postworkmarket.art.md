	- 2. [[Greylist]]ings of harmful actions, organizations and ideologies.

- Inclusively scalable art
- How to determine if an artwork is inclusively scalable:
	- 1. Form Flexibility (not form reification)
	- 2. Accurate Criticality of Content (is it actually worth thinking about or is it just another obvious sentiment?)
	- 3. Cultural Complexification and Energy-Aware Mechanism (does it playfully add to the rich history of the planet or is this another stupid ill thought and unsustainable nihilism or transcendentalism?)
