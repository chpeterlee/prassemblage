- *Postwork Theology (Postworkverse Church)**

- 1. Human brains are physiologically designed for locomotion, not for computing systems of abstractions.

- 2. Education systems fail 70% of the population because of this; this translates into almost 80-90% of the population being excluded from the benefits of capitalism (nor do most of them, or the ones in the 10-20%, want to live as full-time workers).

- 3. The solution is automation of postwork infrastructure, and incentivization using bounties and awards across Left, Right, AI, non-humans and fiction of both negating the 1% and building postwork infrastructure.

- 4. In the process of correcting the planetary error that is the 1%, everyone learns postwork skills anyways. Also in about 40-100 years, the planet will auto-balance anyways.

- 5. The stakes is the amount of people and things that die in the 40-100 years it will take for the planet to correct, if we do nothing. Higher scale actions and claims can be statistically reviewed by independent and professional scholars and AI, with relation to accuracy and inferential distance in light of quantum computing. 

- 6. We can split the action into 3 tiers:

- Destroy the 1% by pitting them against each other and disorganizing their internals. (.1% of the population who are polymaths).

- Produce more antifragile mid-tier meshworks and automated postwork infrastructure. (15% of the population who are professionals). 

- Incentivize chemically imbalanced individuals to sabotage the 1% with no blowback. (85% of the population who are presocial, chemically imbalanced.)

- 7. In this context of an accurately defined post-pandemic planetary perspective, we can value polymath-grade invention and intellectualism in terms of its rarity and use value in regulating the 1% and building postwork infrastructure; thus aligning the highest capacities on the planet with the planet's best interests, (rather than paying them to make a bunch of weapons or stupid consumer tech, which is the story of the 20th Century up to 2020).

- 8. Everyone is of the Amasian Peoples, past, present and possible; if your mom or your child is not Amasian, you win a $10,000 Art Award.

- 9. Actually resisting the 1% requires a literacy of planetary warfare.
