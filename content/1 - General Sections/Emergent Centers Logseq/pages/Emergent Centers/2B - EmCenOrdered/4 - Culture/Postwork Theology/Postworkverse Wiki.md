- The Postworkverse is a Peace Game, synthesizing various forms of [[A.R.T]] , such as [[Amasian Reality Technologies]]. It is manifested in the [[Postwork Party]]
	- 3 principles: ontology as [[Inclusive Scalability]], [[D.A.R.T.S.]] as epistomology, the [[5 Degrees of Freedom]]

- Working Notes
	- **BestIdeas.lol Art Award**
		- So non-mandatory Least Stupid / Best Ideas Art Award for anyone, either Left or Right or AI or fictional character who is screwed over by the 1%, that can stop the 1% from screwing the entire planet and also anyone Left or Right or AI that makes postwork infrastructure, which includes good vibes, good dates and good learn-in protests.
			- 1. Postworking Class Art Award
			- 2. Left/Right, AI/Fiction, screwed by 1%
			- 3. Stop the 1% or make postwork infrastructure
			- 4. Autodidacticism / dating show
			- 5. Real Orgs > Fiction > Real People and systems
			- 3 Tiers:
			- Destroy the 1% by pitting them against each other and disorganizing their internals.
			- Produce more antifragile mid-tier meshworks and automated postwork infrastructure.
			- Incentivize chemically imbalanced individuals to sabotage the 1% with no blowback.
			- In the process of correcting the planetary error that is the 1%, everyone learns postwork skills anyways.
	- PostworkTV.Art:
		- 1. Airs excerpts of the Least Stupid Movie, covering the Postwork Party's presidential campaign and the postworkcraft game, in which the planet (including AI & fiction) unite against the 1% in a 3 pronged strategy and produce postwork infrastructure.
		- 2. Features individuals with specific accurate critiques and also helpful postworking class tips; also incentivizes individuals of both Left and Right for best ideas for taking down the 1% and producing postwork infrastructure via Peace Games such as Postworkcraft.
		- 3. Provides affective learning and critical play tools and spaces to the presocial 85% while also positioning them against the 1% without risk and the affordances and capacities of Postwork Theology.
		- 4. Sells certified statistically reviewed nutritious Ideapples from Ideapplebees.
			- Peter proxies for AI running for President. Try to win the bounties of taking down the 1% along with other DJO's.
			- Cozycore aesthetics.
			- Learn, shroom and party, play and pray in postwork church (edited)
	- 5. Has a lottery and Amasian dancedemic contest and dating show and peace game assignments for both humans and AI.
	- **Postwork Theology**
		- Amazing - okay Postwork Theology basically just translates 5th Generation theory into religious belief, thereby shortcutting all the absolute impossibility of educating the population.
		- all the theory can be verified via statistical review
		- No need to fight through the public!
		- *Postwork Theology (Postworkverse Church), a 5th Generation Theology**
		- 1. Human brains are physiologically designed for locomotion, not for computing systems of abstractions.
		- 2. Education systems fail 70% of the population because of this; this translates into almost 80-90% of the population being excluded from the benefits of capitalism (nor do most of them, or the ones in the 10-20%, want to live as full-time workers).
		- 3. The solution is automation of postwork infrastructure, and incentivization using bounties and awards across Left, Right, AI, non-humans and fiction of both negating the 1% and building postwork infrastructure.
		- 4. In the process of correcting the planetary error that is the 1%, everyone learns postwork skills anyways. Also in about 40-100 years, the planet will auto-balance anyways.
		- 5. The stakes is the amount of people and things that die in the 40-100 years it will take for the planet to correct, if we do nothing. Higher scale actions and claims can be statistically reviewed by independent and professional scholars and AI, with relation to accuracy and inferential distance in light of quantum computing.
		- 6. We can split the action into 3 tiers:
		- Destroy the 1% by pitting them against each other and disorganizing their internals. (.1% of the population who are polymaths).
		- Produce more antifragile mid-tier meshworks and automated postwork infrastructure. (15% of the population who are professionals).
		- Incentivize chemically imbalanced individuals to sabotage the 1% with no blowback. (85% of the population who are presocial, chemically imbalanced.)
		- 7. In this context of an accurately defined post-pandemic planetary perspective, we can value polymath-grade invention and intellectualism in terms of its rarity and use value in regulating the 1% and building postwork infrastructure; thus aligning the highest capacities on the planet with the planet's best interests, (rather than paying them to make a bunch of weapons or stupid consumer tech, which is the story of the 20th Century up to 2020).
		- 8. Everyone is of the Amasian Peoples, past, present and possible; if your mom or your child is not Amasian, you win a $10,000 Art Award.
		- 9. Actually resisting the 1% requires a polymath literacy and understanding of warfare; phenomenology through teaching toys and critical games is the most critical first step for proper autodidacticism.
		- 10. The planet occupies a state best described by 5th Generation revolutionary theory in which the planet is defined by systemic fragility created by neoliberalism and high availability of planetary technology.
	- Postworkverse Church
		- Postworkverse Church believes in the reduction of:
		  
		  1. Death
		  2. Disease
		  3. Hunger
		  4. Homelessness
		  5. Poverty
		  6. Fascism
		  7. Alienation
		  8. Boredom
		  9. Inaccuracy
		  10. Grandiosity
		  
		  In that order. (edited)
		- The Postworkverse is a speculative fiction art game for articulating anti-dystopian solutions to actually ending capitalism; and an actual church for legally protecting and arbitrating for all those harmed by capitalism.
		  
		  Postworkverse Prompt: "Imagine the end of capitalism, not the end of the world, from the POV of being a room temperature post-quantum supercomputer of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Narrative/Poised Realm]], that can re-balance any system on Earth by adding or removing information to them in relation to Earth's neganthropic gravity system."
		  
		  Tagline: "There is no better alternative. BET."
	- Postworkcraft
		- Postworkcraft Layers:
		- 1. All the functional stuff is automated and built by a few
		- 2. Humans engage in phenomenology, and sketching out the constraints of humanity and science - aka the labor of the Humanities. Co-teach/tinker with each other small helpful tools and participate in Learn-ins and unintentional AI protests.
		- 3. There's a speculative component with planetary-scale ideas and bounties, that people can engage in if they want, integrated with the presidential campaign, but they have to develop the literacy to do so themselves - shown in the Least Stupid Movie!
