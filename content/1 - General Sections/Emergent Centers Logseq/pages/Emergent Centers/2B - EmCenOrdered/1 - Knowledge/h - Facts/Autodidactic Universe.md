- The autodidactic universe is a public 0. [[[[inference]] Web 3+]] layer built on the [[Intercity Planetary]] inferential matrix networking photonic computational cameras assemblaged through multiple means.
- The autodidactic universe core principle is premised on the [[inference]] that the universe is composed of visible and invisible photons moving at varying speeds, obeying a universal probabilistic tendency over arbitrary timescales. This overlaps with various [[inference]]s of [[Inferentialism]].
