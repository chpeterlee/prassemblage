- 1. Intro
- An [[inference]] is a datapoint, or a hypothesis, which is always in relation to other existing datapoints. 
  
  [[inference]]s can be qualified to be more or less accurate which can be quantified as more or less probable in relation to a defined set of circumstances, or a [[State Space AI]]. A simple way to grasp what a [[State Space AI]] is, a set of probabilities, is to think about how baseball player statistics are made of a collage of probabilities - or the weather report.

- 3. References
- From Wikipedia:
	- **[[inference]]s** are steps in [reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning), moving from [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise) to [logical consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence); etymologically, the word __[infer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infer)__ means to "carry forward". [[inference]] is theoretically traditionally divided into [deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) and [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning), a distinction that in Europe dates at least to [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (300s BCE). Deduction is [[inference]] [deriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_proof) [logical conclusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence) from premises known or assumed to be [true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth), with the [laws of valid [[inference]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_[[inference]]) being studied in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic). Induction is [[inference]] from [particular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular) premises to a [universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_%28metaphysics%29) conclusion. A third type of [[inference]] is sometimes distinguished, notably by [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce), contradistinguishing [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) from induction.
	- Various fields study how [[inference]] is done in practice . Human [[inference]] (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the fields of logic, argumentation studies, and [cognitive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology); [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) researchers develop automated [[inference]] systems to emulate human [[inference]]. [Statistical [[inference]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_[[inference]]) uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. Statistical [[inference]] uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.
