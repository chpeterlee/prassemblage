	- **Amasia** is a possible future [supercontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent) which could be formed by the merger of [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia) and [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America). The prediction relies mostly on the fact that the [Pacific Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate) is already [subducting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) under [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia) and [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America), a process which if continued will eventually cause the Pacific to close.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasia_%28continent%29#cite_note-1) Meanwhile, because of the [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean) [mid-ocean ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge), North America would be pushed westward. Thus, the Atlantic at some point in the future would be larger than the [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean). In [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia), the boundary between the [Eurasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Plate) and [North American Plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate) has been stationary for millions of years. The combination of these factors would cause North America to be combined with Asia, thus forming a supercontinent. A February 2012 study predicts Amasia will form over the North Pole, in about 50 million to 200 million years.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasia_%28continent%29#cite_note-2)
