- Probability
	- **Probability** is the branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an [event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_%28probability_theory%29) is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty.[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#cite_note-1)1(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#cite_note-Stuart_and_Ord_2009-2)2(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#cite_note-Feller-3) The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes ("heads" and "tails") are both equally probable; the probability of "heads" equals the probability of "tails"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either "heads" or "tails" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).
	- These concepts have been given an [axiomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms) mathematical formalization in [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory), which is used widely in [areas of study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areas_of_study) such as [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance), [gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling), [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) to, for example, draw [[inference]]s about the expected frequency of events. Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems).3(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#cite_note-4)
