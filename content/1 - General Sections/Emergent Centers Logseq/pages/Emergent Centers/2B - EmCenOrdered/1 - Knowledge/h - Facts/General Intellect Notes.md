- **C: "I bet this painting and game could end capitalism". A painting by the 7th Swan - parts which will be proven or disproven in 3-4 months by AI and the PRA in relation to the security of all involved.**Regardless of your position for/against/waiting for information - you have been granted a public share of the royalties of this painting.The aim of this painting is to produce new planetary-scale equality - known as “Open Source Equality”. This is the only initiative fast enough to prevent a child dying every 7 seconds from preventable poverty, reducing unnecessary production, conflict and enabling creativity - and as such will continuously redistribute itself accordingly by any artistic means necessary. This artwork has been bonded and insured through a cryptocurrency tied to open source equality. There is no risk for claiming a share, investing or betting against it or sharing it.The 7th Swan is the name attributed by darkweb artists to an independent planetary-grade generalist inventor (rumored to be a trans Afro-Asian individual) who operates according to 5 rules:
	 - They have sworn to never appear in public or circulate in any media. Thus any individual claiming to be the 7th Swan is 100% not

	 - the 7th Swan.

	 - They will act and encrypt their work through the visible media and the known internet and the subtle guiding of others of all allegiances.

	 - All actions will be aimed towards growing open source equality - which has an empirical metric. To stop children dying of preventable poverty caused by capitalism every 7 seconds. (which is detailed below).

	 - They give free open-source rights to the interpretation of their ideas - yet have a strict 3D system of grading the interpreters, the interpretations and the effects. (detailed below).

	 - An interpreter can be graded thusly:

- A: Ask them what would they do with the money from the Nobel Peace Prize when chosen out of a pool of the top ten minds in the world. Ask them what they would invent if given unlimited funding and access to DARQ.

- B: Ask for an anti-cv or anti-credit from a third party. Ask them how to maintain perpetual peace.
	 - An interpretation can be graded thusly:

- C: Range across 4 domains (ESTA - eco-social-tech-art).

- D: Intensity of low, medium, high and universal ethical futurism.

- E: Possible impact scale of the interpretation: individual, cultural, city, planet.

- F: How the interpretation is articulated, phrased and encrypted.

- answer to these 2 questions:

- G: What are the changes in society that would need to be met in order prior to the safe release of information on how to most intelligently proliferate beyond Earth?

- H: Who is the greatest possible artist of all time?

- - The difficulty of a given invention, deed or idea can be

- graded thusly:

- chosen to simply follow existing paths? What is the scale of the payoffs for constructing a new process?

- K: Was it done with or without guidance? Was it done

- from a minority position or a position of power?

- L: What was the degree of risk and reward over time in respect to catastrophe, death, ruin or exile?An entity’s actions can be roughly judged over time in relation to the amount of minority positions it had overturned across a diversity of domains with larger and larger risks and enablements of novel complexities. This is known as an “Anti-CV”, or “Anti-credit” - which is convertible into currency.Military, sciences and corporations and the commercial art world have no science of novelty. Antifragile artists and generalist individuals have a history of consistently producing ethical inventions that generate new knowledge, new technologies and new economies without destruction and incorporation of the excluded. Individuals with general intelligence can produce specific solutions at various scales across multiple domains better and faster than a team of specialists. Problems must be posed from general to specific or the experimentation will have a high rate of triviality. Capitalism was invented in the 15th Century by German trade networks and the solution to capitalism was invented in 1516.All proceeds will go towards funding the 7th Swan’s “Open Source Equality” initiative which is the only assemblage of initiatives projected to be fast enough to stop a child from dying of preventable poverty every 7 seconds. This initiative is comprised of 7 parts in which information will be meted out in fair compensation to the labor to produce it and the future benefits of its circulation:Proof of the objective incalculability and incomputability and irrefutable subject-independent objectivity of physical reality.Proof of the threat inequality poses to national security in the face of natural disasters.Proof of the inevitable collapse of systems of control, enforcement and exploitative transactions.Proof of the solution of open source universal basic income to capitalism.Proof that de-colonizing technologies, spaces and culture in the names of the dead and displaced will end inequality over time and create post-money societies.Proof that investing in the cultural securities of certified artists of the “anti-fragile guard” to link communities to build a ‘city on a chill' is the most advantageous investment possible.Proof that human culture, past, present and possible exists in relation to dealing with the problems of living on the surface of planet Earth revolving around the sun at 30 km/s and colonizing other planets via spacecraft immediately signals low intelligence.Proof that the gamification of general intelligence, equality and auto-didacticism will balance planetary human development.This painting is a full 12 point ESTA-certified (Eco-social-tech-art) planetary scale antifragile artwork with an extremely high potential for exponential growth of possibilities across all 4 domains. Buy an investor’s share of this artwork based on the New S.A. variation of the Artist Rights’ system by contributing to the kickstarter - which includes a public share of an artistic cryptocurrency automatically redistributing towards open source equality given information and resources on hand.
	 - In addition, you will receive the most valuable possible dataset for the production of value and the reduction of work - the arts.

	 - This painting is using a novel "artistic encryption" method - in which only parts are presented, then bet upon and shared with no risk incurred upon anyone.

	 - Each component will be presented with adequate compensation when deemed safe by AI and a team of anti-fragile academics and artists with outstanding records of ethical integrity.

- Primarily picturing this as a conceptual framework for multiple thinkers, organizers, performers and artists to connect, improvise and mutate freely across class, ethnicity, organization and discipline - while still retaining a greater coherency. Very much like the Collective White House.

- 3 major goals:
	 - Contextualize the work and art and thought produced from 2000's-2020

	 - Present and platform for younger thinkers, artists and activists

	 - Provide a vision of new possibilities that simultaneously fulfill old dreams and enable new desires.

- 1. **Generalist Intelligence**

- A:  Specialist logic - induction/deduction - tends to shut out 99.9% of the possibilities from the get-go. There are various proofs describing the limits of inductive and deductive logic.

- - an empirical one being quantum computing

- - its simultanaeity of computation precedes and out-performs classical computing’s use of inductive and deductive logic

- **B: The limitations of induction/deduction can explain:**
	 - Trump being able to attract populations with his performance. Also - how performance - live or mediated - functions.

	 - Mis-communications creating street killings - and love.

	 - The 95% small business failure rate, the lack of imagination in politics

	 - The published lack of a science of novelty in the military

	 - A continuous crisis of reproducibility in the sciences.

	 - Looking back in the history of revolutions - we see many liberated people simply repeating the hierarchies pre-revolution.

	 - In addition - many oppressed populations tend to recreate the same hierarchies that they were escaping.

	 - A justification for Open Source Universal Basic Income. Unconditional safety and security as the necessary pre-conditions for generalist development. The methods for doing this can be open.

- C: Marx has a concept of liberation via a combination of social, technological and conceptual intelligence called **“General Intellect”** which Paolo Virno elaborated on in an activist context. This is observable by workers who are forced to perform specialized functions - and how generalism is mistakenly contextualized in terms of power and capital.Deleuze and Guattari produced a generalist triad also in the context of Western Philosophy - concept, percept and affect.Manuel De Landa applies this triad to the sciences to declare that “there is no such thing as science” (in terms of greater epistemological authority), John Protevi applies this to the Humanities. [Wrote a great paper on Love](http://www.protevi.com/john/Love.pdf).One of the best young [philosopher-poets](https://fragilekeys.com/) Richard Feynman, Feyerbend, Stuart Kaufmann, Alfred North Whitehead, Alfred Jarry, Leibniz, Da Vinci are examples of generalist thinkers.Non-western and nomadic populations foster generalist skills across genders and ages.Recently, [Reza Negarestani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reza_Negarestani) wrote on “Artificial General Intelligence”. Bernard Stiegler wrote decades ago on arts and “transduction” - a logic that is apt at describing artistic and creative processes of thought.
	 - Non-human intelligence (such as an ecosystem balancing itself) can be contextualized as general intelligence tinkering through multiple agents.

	 - Marshall Mcluhan crafted a generalist position on media - it’s still very usable.

	 - __(This is totally open-ended - I can make a tight synthesis for short publications and it can also serve as a collaborative framework for anyone to riff on from their particular domain of knowledge. I like the way DJ Spooky constructed his book by curating a central concept and using that to commission a series of essays from various different artists. I can work with some writers across the planet using AI to write this. ____________I would love to work with both you and Mohammed Salemy on this - he had asked me to write a book based on my Facebook posts 5 years ago. His organization - __[__The New Centre for Research & practice __](http://thenewcentre.org/)__ is doing well these days. It would be great to connect Provisions with this - he is particularly well established in the European contemporary art scene.)__

- **D: Re-perspectivizing the social landscape through the lens of generalism**
	 - Provisions Library as a model for generalist knowledge/intellectual production - also highlighting generalist tendencies and functions in contemporary art, modernism, cave art, jazz, indigenous art.

	 - Selma Selman’s and various other younger artists' practice  as generalist aesthetics

	 - Floating Lab Collective as generalist cultural/social production

	 - Looking at play/arts pedagogy as generalist education and knowledge production (Floating Lab) - would be great to interview Mason Alum that participated in Floating Lab. Blake for sure.

	 - Looking at new generalist DIY/street culture/open-source engineering - and informal economies in S. America / E.Europe / Mid East / Asia / across the planet

	 - Looking at non-Western/non-modern generalist cultures (nomads - also the Caucasus culture)

	 - Look at  various forms of non-governmentality (a South African rapper that fused political negotiation with rap. A skilled laborers' strike.)

	 - Look at non-human generalism in ecosystems, organisms, landscapes, planets, galaxies.

	 - __(I have a network of really good research-based artists who can do this collaboratively. The most rich information on this stuff imo comes from the non-western artists who are not in the Venice Biennale top-tier of international artists.)__

- -----
	 - **The General Intelligence Agency:** Use the concept as a framework for multiple researchers to conversate and connect across cities and disciplines for novel thought, discuss the problem of militarized knowledge production, discuss the functional priority of generalism before specialization and discuss how generalism functions in terms of ecology/evolution.

- (podcast/livestream/text publication - I have this great character I perform with called Osubi - a fat pink unicorn who is a 4-dimensional quantum guru that can transmit answers from a future equality. A bit like Ishmael (thanks for putting me on to that book).

- I’m also talking to Matt Nolan about making printed books. He’s done one for me before.

- Also - I and my buddy have been making lists of generalists on the planet. I’m sure you know some also. When I was in grad school, I created an organization called “The [[Planetary Research Assemblage]]” and contacted one - [Stuart Kaufmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVL2Y5z2jLU). I would also love to get in contact with [Manuel De Landa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-I5e7ixw78).

- Also there are many younger philosophers and poets I worked with in grad school - I would love to bring them to light. They are doing amazing things.

- Community organizers can use the General Intelligence Agency to improvise new connections and negotiations for more equitable spaces that flow resources to the most needy and create new interconnections between city workers (Ben + Sue).**Planetary Party:** Can use conceptual/participatory performance to induce positive, pro-social, trans-generational, trans-cultural play and performance to connect immigrant, academic and worker populations in public spaces across the planet. I’ve been having great conversations with my mom about the history of Korea because I was stuck from Corona - I would like to re-perform them to educate the 2nd generation. I also know alot of 2nd generation immigrants have trouble bridging the language gap - I have a bunch of performance techniques that allow them to connect (like speaking multiple languages regarding the traumas of their countries while blindfolded - I’ll post a video later).__ (Peter + other immigrant and net-performance friendly millenials (I know a bunch all over the planet now from the Syracuse University graduate program.
