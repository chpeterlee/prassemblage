	- In science, computing, and engineering, a **black box** is a system which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or [transfer characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function)), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is "opaque" (black). The term can be used to refer to many inner workings, such as the ones of a [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor), an [engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine), an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain), or an institution or government.
	- To analyse an [open system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_%28systems_theory%29) with a typical "black box approach", only the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) __box__. The usual representation of this __black box system__ is a [data flow diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_diagram) centered in the box.
	- The opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a [white box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_box_%28software_engineering%29) (sometimes also known as a "clear box" or a "glass box"1(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-1)).

	- A black box model can be used to describe the outputs of systems
	- The modern meaning of the term "black box" seems to have entered the English language around 1945. In electronic [circuit theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_theory) the process of [network synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_synthesis) from [transfer functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function), which led to electronic circuits being regarded as "black boxes" characterized by their response to signals applied to their [ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_%28circuit_theory%29), can be traced to [Wilhelm Cauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Cauer) who published his ideas in their most developed form in 1941.2(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-2) Although Cauer did not himself use the term, others who followed him certainly did describe the method as black-box analysis.3(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-3) [Vitold Belevitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitold_Belevitch)4(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-4) puts the concept of black-boxes even earlier, attributing the explicit use of [two-port networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-port_network) as black boxes to [Franz Breisig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Breisig) in 1921 and argues that 2-terminal components were implicitly treated as black-boxes before that.
	- In [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics), a full treatment was given by [Ross Ashby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ashby) in 1956.5(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-ash56-5) A black box was described by [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener) in 1961 as an unknown system that was to be identified using the techniques of [system identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_identification).6(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-6) He saw the first step in [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_organization#Self-organization_in_cybernetics) as being to be able to copy the output behavior of a black box. Many other engineers, scientists and epistemologists, such as [Mario Bunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bunge),7(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-Bunge63-7) used and perfected the black box theory in the 1960s.
- System theory[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_box&action=edit&section=2)]
	- ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/OpenSystemRepresentation.svg/252px-OpenSystemRepresentation.svg.png)[🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OpenSystemRepresentation.svg)
	- [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OpenSystemRepresentation.svg)
	- The __[open system theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_%28systems_theory%29)__ is the foundation of __black box theory__. Both have focus on input and output flows, representing exchanges with the surroundings.
	- In [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory), the __black box__ is an abstraction representing a class of concrete [open system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_%28systems_theory%29) which can be viewed solely in terms of its __stimuli inputs__ and __output reactions__:
	- The constitution and structure of the box are altogether irrelevant to the approach under consideration, which is purely external or phenomenological. In other words, only the behavior of the system will be accounted for.
	- — [Mario Bunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bunge)7(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-Bunge63-7)
	- The understanding of a __black box__ is based on the "explanatory principle", the [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis) of a [causal relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_relation) between the __input__ and the __output__. This principle states that __input__ and __output__ are distinct, that the system has observable (and relatable) inputs and outputs and that the system is black to the observer (non-openable).8(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-gla09-8)
- Recording of observed states[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_box&action=edit&section=3)]
	- An observer makes observations over time. All observations of inputs and outputs of a __black box__ can be written in a table, in which, at each of a sequence of times, the states of the __box’s__ various parts, input and output, are recorded. Thus, using an example from [Ashby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ross_Ashby), examining a box that has fallen from a [flying saucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_saucer) might lead to this protocol:5(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-ash56-5)
	- TimeStates of input and output
	- 11:18I did nothing—the Box emitted a steady hum at 240 Hz.
	- 11:19I pushed over the switch marked K: the note rose to 480 Hz and remained steady.
	- 11:20I accidentally pushed the button marked “!”—the Box increased in temperature by 20 °C.
	- ...Etc.
	- Thus every system, fundamentally, is investigated by the collection of a long protocol, drawn out in time, showing the sequence of input and output states. From this there follows the fundamental deduction that all knowledge obtainable from a Black Box (of given input and output) is such as can be obtained by re-coding the protocol (the __observation table__); all that, and nothing more.5(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-ash56-5)
	- If the observer also controls input, the investigation turns into an [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) (illustration), and hypotheses about [cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality) can be tested directly.
	- When the experimenter is also motivated to control the box, there is an active feedback in the box/observer relation, promoting what in [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system) is called a [feed forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_forward_%28control%29) architecture.

	- With backtesting, out of time data is always used when testing the black box model. Data has to be written down before it is pulled for black box inputs.

	- The observed [hydrograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrograph) is a graphic of the response of a [watershed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin) (a blackbox) with its [runoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff) (red) to an input of rainfall (blue).
	- __Black box theories__ are those theories defined only in terms of their function.10(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-10)11(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-CP-11) The term __black box theory__ is applied to any field, [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) and [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) or otherwise where some inquiry or definition is made into the relations between the appearance of a system (exterior/outside), i.e. here specifically the system's black box state, related to its characteristics and behaviour within (interior/inner).12(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-12)13(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-13)
	- Specifically, the inquiry is focused upon a system that has no immediately apparent characteristics and therefore has only factors for consideration held within itself hidden from immediate observation. The observer is assumed ignorant in the first instance as the majority of available [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) is held in an inner situation away from [facile](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/facile) investigations. The __black box__ element of the definition is shown as being characterised by a system where observable elements enter a perhaps imaginary box with a set of different outputs emerging which are also observable.14(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-14)
- Adoption in humanities[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_box&action=edit&section=7)]
	- In [humanities disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities) such as [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind) and [behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism), one of the uses of black box theory is to describe and understand [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological) factors in fields such as marketing when applied to an analysis of [consumer behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_behaviour).15(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-15)16(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-16)17(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-17)

	- __Black Box theory__ is even wider in application than professional studies:
	- The child who tries to open a door has to manipulate the handle (the input) so as to produce the desired movement at the latch (the output); and he has to learn how to control the one by the other without being able to see the internal mechanism that links them. In our daily lives we are confronted at every turn with systems whose internal mechanisms are not fully open to inspection, and which must be treated by the methods appropriate to the Black Box.
	- — Ashby5(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-ash56-5)
	- (...) This simple rule proved very effective and is an illustration of how the Black Box principle in cybernetics can be used to control situations that, if gone into deeply, may seem very complex.
	- A further example of the Black Box principle is the treatment of mental patients. The human brain is certainly a Black Box, and while a great deal of neurological research is going on to understand the mechanism of the brain, progress in treatment is also being made by observing patients' responses to stimuli.
	- — Duckworth, Gear and Lockett18(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-18)
- Applications[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_box&action=edit&section=9)]

	- When the observer (an [agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system)) can also do some stimulus (input), the relation with the black box is not only an observation, but an [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment).
- Computing and mathematics[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_box&action=edit&section=10)]
	- In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) and [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), __[black box testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box_testing)__ is used to check that the output of a program is as expected, given certain inputs.19(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-19) The term "black box" is used because the actual program being executed is not examined.
	- In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) in general, a __black box program__ is one where the user cannot see the inner workings (perhaps because it is a [closed source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_source) program) or one which has no side effects and the function of which need not be examined, a routine suitable for re-use.
	- Also in [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a black box refers to a piece of equipment provided by a vendor for the purpose of using that vendor's product. It is often the case that the vendor maintains and supports this equipment, and the company receiving the black box typically is hands-off.
	- In [mathematical modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model), a limiting case.
- Science and technology[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_box&action=edit&section=11)]
	- In [neural networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) or [heuristic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_algorithm) (computer terms generally used to describe 'learning' computers or 'AI simulations'), a black box is used to describe the constantly changing section of the program environment which cannot easily be tested by the programmers. This is also called a [white box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_box_%28software_engineering%29) in the context that the program code can be seen, but the code is so complex that it is functionally equivalent to a black box.
	- In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), a black box is a system whose internal structure is unknown, or need not be considered for a particular purpose.
	- In [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) to capture the notion of knowledge obtained by an algorithm through the execution of a [cryptographic protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol) such as a [zero-knowledge proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) protocol. If the output of an algorithm when interacting with the protocol matches that of a simulator given some inputs, it only needs to know the inputs.
- Other applications[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_box&action=edit&section=12)]
	- In [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) and [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), the school of [behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism) sees the human mind as a black box;20(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#cite_note-FriSil06-20) see __[other theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box#Other_theories)__.
