	- **Amasya** (Turkish pronunciation: [[aˈmasja]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Turkish); [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language): Ἀμάσεια) is a city in northern [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) and is the capital of [Amasya Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya_Province), in the [Black Sea Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Region). It used to be called **Amaseia** or **Amasia** in antiquity.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-Brit-3) Amasya stands in the mountains above the [Black Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea) coast, set apart from the rest of Anatolia in a narrow valley along the banks of the [Yeşilırmak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye%C5%9Fil%C4%B1rmak_%28river%29) River. Although near the Black Sea, this area is high above the coast and has an inland climate, well-suited to growing apples, for which Amasya province, one of the provinces in north-central Anatolia Turkey, is famed. It was the home of the geographer [Strabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo) and the birthplace of the 15th century scholar and physician [Amirdovlat Amasiatsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amirdovlat_Amasiatsi). Located in a narrow cleft of the Yeşilırmak (Iris) river, it has a history of 7,500 years which has left many traces still evident today.
	- In antiquity, Amaseia was a fortified city high on the cliffs above the river. It has a long history as a wealthy provincial capital, producing kings and princes, artists, scientists, poets and thinkers, from the kings of [Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_%28region%29), through [Strabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo) the geographer, to many generations of the Ottoman imperial dynasty. With its Ottoman-period wooden houses and the tombs of the Pontus kings carved into the cliffs overhead, Amasya is attractive to visitors. In recent years, there has been much investment in tourism, and therefore more foreign and Turkish tourists have visited the city.
	- During the early [Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) rule, it was customary for young Ottoman princes to be sent to Amasya to govern and gain experience. Amasya was also the birthplace of the [Ottoman sultans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_sultans) [Murad I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murad_I) and [Selim I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selim_I). Traditional [Ottoman houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_architecture) near the Yeşilırmak and the other main historical buildings have been restored; these traditional Yalıboyu houses are now used as cafes, restaurants, pubs and hotels. Behind the Ottoman wooden houses one can see the rock tombs of the Pontic kings.

	- An independent [Pontic kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Pontus) with its capital at Amaseia was established by the [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people) [Mithridatic dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridatic_dynasty) at the end of the 4th century BC, in the wake of [Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great)'s conquests. In the 1st century BC, it briefly contested Rome's hegemony in Anatolia. By 183 BC, the city was settled by Greeks, eventually becoming the capital of the kings of [Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_%28region%29) from 333 BC to 26 BC. Today, there are prominent ruins including the [royal tombs of Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombs_of_the_kings_of_Pontus) in the rocks above the riverbank in the centre of the city.

	- Amaseia was captured by a force led by the [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome) [Lucullus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucullus) in 70 BC and was quickly made a free city and administrative center of his new province of [Bithynia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bithynia) and [Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_%28region%29) by [Pompey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey). By this time, Amaseia was a thriving city, the home of thinkers, writers and poets, and one of them, [Strabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo), left a full description of Amaseia as it was between 60 BC and 19 AD. Around 2 or 3 BC, it was incorporated into the Roman province of [Galatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatia_%28Roman_province%29), in the district of Pontus Galaticus. Around the year 112, the emperor [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) designated it a part of the province of [Cappadocia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-OCD-5) Later in the 2nd century it gained the titles '[metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis)' and 'first city'. After the division of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) by emperor [Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian) the city became part of the [East Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Roman_Empire) (the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire)). At this time it had a predominantly Greek-speaking population.[__[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)__]
	- Amaseia was also referenced in the first book of the [Alexiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexiad). Amaseia was the town where [Emperor Alexios I Komnenos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexios_I_Komnenos) received the Norman general [Ursel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roussel_de_Bailleul) as a captive from the Turkic general Tutach. Ursel had, according to the book, looted and pillaged the Eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire until the at-the-time General Alexios convinced Tutach to capture him. Alexios agreed that he would pay "...such a sum of money as no one ever gained before." to Tutach for the capture of Ursel, however Alexios had no cash to give and the Emperor was unable to fund it, so he attempted to raise money from the people of Amaseia, however this caused serious unrest. However, after a speech by Alexios, he arranged a mock-blinding of Ursel which promptly caused the people to contribute funds. However, this is likely to be biased.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-6)

	- In 2013, a 24-square-meter christian mosaic belonging to the floor of a chapel was discovered, near a site where an illegal archaeological dig had been attempted.

	- In 1075, ending 700 years of Byzantine rule, Amasya was conquered by the [Turkmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghuz_Turks) [Danishmend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danishmends) emirs.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8) It served as their capital until the annexation of the Danishmendid dominions by the [Seljuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Rum) ruler [Kilij Arslan II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilij_Arslan_II).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8) When he died, his realm was divided among his sons, and Amasya passed to [Nizam ad-Din Arghun Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nizam_ad-Din_Arghun_Shah&action=edit&redlink=1). His rule was brief, as he lost it to his brother [Rukn ad-Din Suleiman Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rukn_ad-Din_Suleiman_Shah), who subsequently became Sultan.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8) During the 13th century the city passed under the control of the [Mongol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire) [Ilkhanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanate), and was ruled by Mongol governors, except for a brief rule by [Taj ad-Din Altintash](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taj_ad-Din_Altintash&action=edit&redlink=1), son of the last Seljuk sultan, [Mesud II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesud_II).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8)
	- Under the Seljuks and the Ilkhan, the city became a centre of Islamic culture and produced some notable individuals such as [Yaqut al-Musta'simi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaqut_al-Musta%27simi) (1221-1298) calligrapher and secretary of the last Abbasid caliph who was a [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks) native of Amasya.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-Houtsma_1987-9) Schools, mosques, tombs and other architecture of this period still remain.[__[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)__]
	- In 1341, the emir [Habiloghlu](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Habiloghlu&action=edit&redlink=1) occupied the city, before it came under the rule of the [Eretnid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eretnid) emirate. [Hadji Shadgeldi Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hadji_Shadgeldi_Pasha&action=edit&redlink=1) took Amasya from the Eretnids under Ali Bey, and successfully fended off the claims of [Kadi Burhan al-Din](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadi_Burhan_al-Din), who had supplanted the Eretnids.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8) Shadgeldi was succeeded by his son Ahmed, who managed to retain his autonomy for a while, with Ottoman assistance; but in 1391/92, the [mounting pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_K%C4%B1rkdilim) forced him to cede the city to the Ottoman sultan [Bayezid I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayezid_I), who installed his son, the future [Mehmed I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_I), as its governor.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-10)

	- After the disastrous [Battle of Ankara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ankara) in 1402, Mehmed I fled to Amasya, which (along with nearby [Tokat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokat)) became his main residence and stronghold during the [Ottoman Interregnum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Interregnum).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-11)
	- As a result, the city enjoyed a special status under the Ottomans.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8) A number of Ottoman princes were sent to the province of Amasya (the [Rûm Eyalet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BBm_Eyalet)) as governors in their youth, from Mehmed II in the late 14th century to [Bayezid II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayezid_II) in the 15th century, through to [Murat III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murat_III) in the 16th century.[__[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)__]
	- [Suleiman the Magnificent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent) often stayed in the city, and even received the [Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Monarchy) ambassador [Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogier_Ghiselin_de_Busbecq) there.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8) Already distinguished a cultural centre under the Seljuks, Amasya now "became one of the main seats of learning in Anatolia".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-EI2-8)
	- Between 1530 and 1545, several travelers documented a [blood libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel) against some of the town's [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-jewishencyclopedia.com-12) After the disappearance of a local [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians), several [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) living in town were blamed for killing him for ritual reasons. The Jews confessed under torture and were hanged. When the supposed victim was discovered to still be alive, Sultan [Suleiman the Magnificent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent) ordered that all accusations regarding religious rituals should be judged under "royal" and not local court.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-jewishencyclopedia.com-12) In 1555, Amasya was also the location for the signing of the [Peace of Amasya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Amasya) with the Safavid dynasty of Persia.[__[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)__]
	- The population of Amasya at this time was very different from that of most other cities in the Ottoman Empire, as it was part of their training for the future sultans to learn about every nation of the Empire. Every [millet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_system) of the Empire was represented in Amasya in a particular village—such as a Greek village, an Armenian village, a Bosnian village, a Tatar village, a Turkish village etc. (see: 1927 Population count data by DİE)

	- In 1919 Amasya was the location of the final planning meetings held by Mustafa Kemal [Atatürk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk) for the building of a Turkish army to establish the Turkish republic following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the First World War. It was here that Mustafa Kemal made the announcement of the [Turkish War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence) in the [Amasya Circular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya_Circular). This circular is considered as the first written document putting the Turkish War of Independence in motion. The circular, distributed across Anatolia, declared Turkey's independence and integrity to be in danger and called for a national conference to be held in [Sivas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivas) ([Sivas Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivas_Congress)) and before that, for a preparatory congress comprising representatives from the eastern provinces of Anatolia to be held in [Erzurum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erzurum) in July ([Erzurum Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erzurum_Congress)).[__[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)__]
	- During the years of [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and the [Turkish War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence), the Christian inhabitants of Amasya (Armenian and Greek) suffered from atrocities. Many Armenian civilians fleeing the attacks sought refuge at the American missionary school [Anatolia College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia_College), located in [Merzifon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merzifon) outside Amasya. In 1921, Turkish troops closed down the school, and the local population relocated to [Thessaloniki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki) after the [population exchange between Greece and Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-13) Also, in 1921 there was the [Amasya trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya_trials) which were special ad hoc trials, organized by the [Turkish National Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_National_Movement), with the purpose to kill the Greek representatives of [Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_%28region%29) region under a legal pretext.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasya#cite_note-Hofmann208-14)

From the 12th century the Christian element was reduced due to the [Turkic migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_migration) into Anatolia. The Orthodox metropolis of Amasea was active until the [Population exchange between Greece and Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey) (1923) and in 1922 counted c. 40,000 Christians, 20,000 of them being Greek speakers.

- The legend of Ferhat and Shirin[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amasya&action=edit&section=11)]
	- In its Turkish version, this classic tale of oriental folklore is held to have taken place in Amasya. The nearby mountain __Ferhat__ is named for [Farhad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhad) (Turkish spelling Ferhat), the hero of the legend, who for love of the princess [Shirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirin) (Turkish spelling Şirin) tried to win her father's favour and permission by tunnelling through the mountain to bring spring water to his palace. Sadly, while he was working he was sent the false information that Shirin had died; upon which he threw himself onto the rocks in his grief. And his beloved princess died soon after. The story has since become a play by [Nâzım Hikmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A2z%C4%B1m_Hikmet), a novel by [Talip Apaydın](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talip_Apayd%C4%B1n&action=edit&redlink=1), and an opera by [Arif Melikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arif_Melikov&action=edit&redlink=1).[__[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)__]
- Climate[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amasya&action=edit&section=12)]
	- Amasya has a [hot-summer Mediterranean climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-summer_Mediterranean_climate) (Csa) under [Köppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification) classification and a hot summer oceanic climate (Doa) under the [Trewartha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trewartha_climate_classification) classification. Also, Amasya is warmer than central Anatolia, and its weather is not as cold in winter months. It has a transitional climate between the oceanic climate of the Black Sea and a continental and Mediterranean climate. However, this narrow valley causes Amasya to have a temperate climate. This effect is due to the Yeşilirmak river that moderates its climate.
