##### Stupidity and Fragility is Accurately Measurable via [[Semiotechne]], Thus Allowing Us to Wager and Profit on Preventable and Stupid Individual or Organizational Collapse, Which There is Copious Amounts of

[[Semiotechne]] allows us to produce extremely effective and accurate definitions of both fragility and stupidity which afflict the powerful and the oppressed alike. Now finally, we can have an accurate critical position without the stupidity of racism or dialectic inversions.

1. [[Semiotechne]] is the understanding of semiotic processes as affected by techne, and technological processes affected by semiotics.
2.[[neganthropic evolution]]has a general statistical trajectory towards inclusive scalability over time; particular processes can be measured as net entropic or [[Negentropic]] in relation to costs.
3. Hence, stupidity and fragility is that which will not survive evolution's relentless fumbling towards inclusive scalability. It can be quantified in relation to a problem space.

[[Semiotechne]] easily resolves longstanding problems in both Humanities and Sciences (thanks Stiegler):

1. First of all, [[Semiotechne]] is an [[Assemblage]]comprised of PROCESSES. Which means it's independent of any particular physical entity and can function through it. Retains immanence while also maintaining energy constraints. This also leaves the door open to simply say that the universe is made of a generic quantum chemical, compounded in infinite forms.
2. The PROCESSES utilize both informational and physical systems, thus, we can bypass the poorly phrased problem of "what is reality made of, matter or mind".
3. There are statistical constraints to [[Semiotechne]], so we can keep history and[[neganthropic evolution]]and simply align [[Semiotechne]] according to this - which naturally produces its own ethics. 
4. This ethics effectively says that the most bang for buck activities are 2 fold: information discovery and exteriorization. 
5. Cool, this poses also a much more solid support and ramifications for the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]XES of cosmopolitics which is intertwined with the activity of thinking and mediating it. Amazing, now we've truly escaped the stupidity of the prior decades!

Simple as f--k! [[Semiotechne]] solves every single hard problem!

Place bets on what are the best ideas and artworks for the planet. 

Most adults are fragile teenagers due to all the cuts from neoliberalism; they should just take psychedelics and youtube.
