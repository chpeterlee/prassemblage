- 1. Abstract
- Inclusive scalability is a dual criteria used across cultural, technical and intellectual fields to assess the likelihood that a decision will result in [[net negentropic]] outcomes within a system. The criteria can be tested using a [[genetic algorithm]] which can be simulated in varying levels of complexity. Additional [[Statistical Review]]s can be conducted.
- Inclusivity must allow for unprestateable expressivities, including unpredictable and circumstantial exclusionary expressions. However, due to the unscaleability of exclusionary expressions, they will always be declared unscalealeable.
- Scaleability measures the non-linear relations between parts to determine a ratio of time and energy cost to sustainable complexity and connectivity. A small sample of relations or inferences of a larger system can be examined for their time and energy cost and their fragility or antifragility can be projected in relation to possible externalities. Exponential collapse or exponential growth can be forecasted from examining the resilience of the component relations of a process, deliverable or goal.
- Components comprising processes, deliverables and goals can be conceptualized in terms of tasks and transformations as defined within [[Constructor Theory]]. These relations can be qualified as fragile or antifragile recombinations and then quantified according to their degrees of scaleability and inclusivity.

- 2. History
- Inclusive scalability draws upon ideas of [[Antifragility]], in which systems gain from disorder, or non-linear probabilistic interactions, which result in the formation of [[net negentropic]] system states. The term of antifragility has been applied to organizational systems, ecological systems and informational systems.
- The concept of antifragility, as introduced by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book "Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder", is based on the idea that some systems not only resist damage from stressors but actually benefit from them. In the context of inclusive scalability, antifragility refers to the ability of a system to not only withstand stressors but to also improve and evolve as a result of them, leading to net negentropic system states.
- For example, an antifragile organizational system would be able to adapt and learn from stressors, becoming more resilient and efficient as a result. In ecological systems, antifragility can be seen in the ability of some species to thrive in unpredictable environments, such as deserts or arctic tundras. In the context of informational systems, antifragility can refer to the ability of algorithms or machine learning models to improve and become more accurate over time, as they are exposed to more data and inputs.
- Inclusive scalability can also describe how evolutionary processes, such as bifurcations, individuations, or cladogenesis, can lead to the development of systems that are more efficient, connected, and adaptive. These processes are driven by selection pressures that favor traits and capacities that minimize energy cost and risk while maximizing connectivity and opportunity.
- For example, during cladogenesis, a population may split into two or more subpopulations that evolve in different directions, leading to the development of new species. This process can be driven by selection pressures that favor traits that enhance the ability to extract resources from the environment or to avoid predation, while minimizing energy cost and risk.
- Similarly, during individuation or bifurcations, a system may develop new structures or functions that allow it to better adapt to its environment. These new structures or functions can be selected for based on their ability to improve connectivity and opportunity, while minimizing energy cost and risk.
- In all of these cases, inclusive scalability can be seen as the driving force behind the evolution of systems that are more efficient, connected, and adaptive, leading to net negentropic system states.

- 3. Applications
- Inclusive scalability can also be seen as a negentropic autopoietic system, which is a self-organizing system that maintains its own structure and organization through the exchange of matter and energy with its environment. Autopoiesis was first introduced by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to describe the self-maintaining nature of living organisms.
- An autopoietic system is characterized by its ability to self-organize and self-reproduce, and it can be seen as an emergent system, meaning that the system's properties and behaviors emerge from the interactions of its constituent parts. Inclusive scalability can be seen as an emergent property of a system that has the ability to maintain its structure and organization through the exchange of matter and energy with its environment, while also being able to adapt and evolve in response to stressors or changes in its environment.
- Inclusive scalability as a negentropic autopoietic system, therefore, refers to the ability of a system to maintain and improve its organization and complexity over time, leading to net negentropic system states, while also being able to adapt and evolve in response to changes in its environment.
- It is also possible to read precursors of concepts of ideas of inclusive scalability in the Humanities - such as in understandings of grace in Christianity, spirit in Hegel, or The Middle Way in Buddhism.
- For example, in Christianity, the concept of grace can be understood as a force that enables individuals to grow and evolve towards a state of greater spiritual connectivity and opportunity, while minimizing the negative effects of sin and other obstacles. Similarly, in Hegelian philosophy, the idea of spirit refers to a process of self-realization in which individuals and societies evolve towards greater levels of connectivity, opportunity, and self-awareness.
- In Buddhism, the Middle Way is a concept that refers to the path of balance between extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification. The Middle Way is seen as a path towards greater connectivity and opportunity, as well as greater spiritual awareness and understanding.
- All of these ideas share a common emphasis on the importance of balance, connectivity, and opportunity in the process of growth and evolution. They recognize that in order to evolve towards more net negentropic states, individuals and systems must be able to adapt to changing circumstances while minimizing energy cost and risk.

- 4. Inferrable Worldview
- Inclusive scalability allows for an optimistic worldview, in which there is always multiple adjacent possible inclusively scalable options for problems at the pyschological scale, the social scale and the plaentary scale - even if they are not known by a given perspective at any given time.
- inclusive scalability does allow for an optimistic worldview. By recognizing the potential for multiple adjacent possibilities for inclusively scalable solutions, it allows individuals and systems to maintain a sense of flexibility and openness, even in the face of uncertainty and change. This can help to reduce anxiety and increase the likelihood of positive outcomes.
- Inclusive scalability also acknowledges that our understanding of the world is always limited and subject to change. There may be inclusively scalable options that we are not aware of at a given time, but that could become available in the future as our knowledge and technology advances. By maintaining an open and adaptive mindset, we can remain receptive to new possibilities and increase the likelihood of inclusive scalability in our decision-making.
- Overall, inclusive scalability offers a hopeful and empowering framework for problem-solving at multiple scales, from the individual to the planetary. It encourages us to look for solutions that are both resilient and inclusive, and to remain open to the potential for positive change and growth.

- 5. Applied Methods
- Inclusive Scalability as an evaluation protocol:
- The question of "Is this inclusively scaleable?" can be proposed at any time by any human or quantum-aware entity. Inclusive scaleability always incorporates increasingly more inclusively scaleable proposals and adaptations and compensates accordingly. Thus, inclusive scaleability produces a perspective spanning reference point across processes, deliverables and goals which is also immediately responsive to unpredictable novel information, byproducts and proposals.
- Working Notes:
	- These ideas seem to be related to the concept of systems theory, which is a multidisciplinary field that explores the behavior of complex systems.
	- Fundamental implications regarding thought and praxes:
		- 1. Miseducation and traumatization is worse than no education. The time and energy costs to reverse the damage are enormous.
		- 2. No specific structured conceptual methodology is mandatory.
		- 3. Thought and art is non-hierarchical.
		- 4. Auto-didacticism is immanent.
		- 5. Defined outcomes within defined constraints can be probabilistically estimated through non-linear metrics. Indefinite outcomes with indefinite constraints must be explored with minimal time and energy cost processes and environments of maximal complexity and connectivity.
		- The highest level of confirmation can come from polymaths and simulators to form regional-scale systems, whether urban, suburban or rural. Reza Negarestani, Manuel De Landa, Stuart Kaufmann and simulators are able to evaluate solutions to artificial carbon sequestration and the problem of 12,000 children dying per day of preventable poverty. Also, they can verify a solution to the Hamiltonian equation which can resolve physics and open a path towards engineering past [[solar change]].

	- Inclusive scaleability can be arrived at autodidactically without prior training, independent of any particular methodology but always in relation to a defined environment's physical rates of change. Thus a past history of an individual's production of inclusive scaleability can provide a rough measure of their capacity to produce it consistently within pre-defined or un-prestated constraints. Training can be provided to varying degrees to accelerate skill transfer. Skills can be rated in 5 levels; inclusive scaleability at an individual scale, a small group scale, a city scale, a regional scale and a planetary scale. In addition, any particular entity can be shown objectively to benefit from inclusive scaleability, even if they do not have the literacies required to evaluate it - but other qualified perspectives can through verifiable arguments and mathematical proofs. By definition, the inclusion of non-engagement toward inclusively scaleable ends is inclusively scaleable. This is similar to how hearts function, or photosynthesis, or the nuclear fusion occurring in the sun.
