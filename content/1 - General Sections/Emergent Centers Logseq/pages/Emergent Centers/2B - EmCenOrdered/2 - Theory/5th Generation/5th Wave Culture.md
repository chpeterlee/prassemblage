**[[Neganthropology]]: Foundation of**

**Fifth Wave Culture, Cosmopolitical & Postwork Protest and the Cool School [[2- Notes/K. 6th Level Logics/Healightenment]].**

1.  Basically, a relation to information in which the subject, human or non-human is seeking that which produces an unpredictable perspectival shift (or invagination).
2.  Basically,[[neganthropic evolution]]via unexpected encounter, which can be through physical or informational means.
3.  This produces a novel paradigm of feminism, one founded on paradigm shifts itself.

**The Postwork Fist** - a martial art invented by self-appointed grandmaster of the Postwork Fist, Chongha Peter Lee

1. **Dont work smarter or harder; just postwork protest it.**
2. The world is incapacitated by **1980's Trickle Down Fragility** which benefited the 1%, who owe everyone reparations for 500 years of illegal war crimes.
3. There is a high availability of planetary-scale technologies; there is always an effort to control them by institutions and a mistaken stigmatization by communities.
4. Only a few [[polymath]]s currently can ethically operate planetary infrastructure; potentially a child could teach themselves to do so in a year.
5. We need an automation of production, distribution, regulation of postwork infrastructure; rest, care and education for humans.





**5th Wave Culture / Invagination / [[Neganthropology]] / [[2- Notes/K. 6th Level Logics/Healightenment]] /  Postworkwave / Postwork Protest / Cosmopolitical Protest

1. Information, in tangible or less tangible forms, produces events.
2. Events can be entropic (which may not simply just be repetition or novelty - depends on their effects within the dynamic balancing of a system in past, pressent and adjacent possible states).
3. Events can produce an unexpected [[Neganthropic]] invagination (or bifurcation) towards [[Antifragility]] and inclusive scalability.
4. Every second we engage in the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]xes thinking, or learning by doing, or even resting, we are faced with constant opportunities to invaginate, bifurcate and etc - which is a cosmopolitical protest against entropy and uninclusive systems.

5.[[neganthropic evolution]]functions through systems bifurcating or invaginating towards inclusive scalability; this anchors and reorients feminism and struggles towards continuous syntheses of paradigm shifts and complexifications of more inclusively scalable tools and info. 
6. We can separate the transfer of information from the culture of affects assigned to it; it doesn't have to be boring or serious or separated from the act of protest itself!
7. There is a precedent for play-based education, using material toys to convey complex conceptual systems, and using existing cultural and fictional entities such as angels, demons, spirits or non-existent characters to engage with individuals.

  Real talk: our cultures are way too stupid for art, philosophy, and science at this time - we are 40 to 100 years away from having complex conversations.
  
  So what cultures do we actually have now?
  
  1. Individuals: Fashion, sports, food.
  2. Social interaction: games and film, parties, theater.
  3. Systems: hackathons and bounties, news and lectures, wagers and apps.

  "[[Postworkcraft]] bounty on proportional non-lethal sabotage of high visibility fragile individuals" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023
  
  Without education, skill and ethics, thought isn't even possible, much less organizing and invention. The only thing people can do is destroy something.
  
  Okay! Let's channel the most base, stupid and vicious instincts of the populations.
  
  
  ---
  Our populations are deskilled, undereducated and unethical ... what can they actually do?
  
  1. Destroy stuff
  2. Take drugs
  3. Have horrible dates
  
  So if this is the only thing they can reliably produce and it's far too late to teach them- then the only thing that makes sense is to use them as stupidity grenades that you throw at anything you want to destroy.

  Shouldn't be hard at all to agree up on who to destroy.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  [[Postworkcraft]]:
  
  Comprised of various minigames, not everyone can or has to do everything! Most of our populations are deskilled, undereducated and unethical adolescents. Let's aim this Teenergy in the right direction!
  
  1. Deskilled - make cozycore art that balances out the burnout of learning.
  2. Undereducated - postwork protest by learning or resting.
  3. Unethical - make speculative fiction about the revenge of the oppressed on the 1%.

- #### [[Postworkcraft]] Premise:
  
  Suddenly the wretched of the Earth have gained Postworking Class consciousness. 99% of them are deskilled, undereducated and unethical thieves, scammers and killers. They all have the mentality and superpowers of a 17 year old adolescent, also known as **Teenergy**. Sometimes they call themselves the[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]Rebel Alliance.
  
  They have all the planetary-scale technology of 2023, and they're all reading [[Bernard Stiegler]]'s theory of the [[Neganthropocene]] along with 5th Generation Revolutionary theory. They can enlist the aid of past, present and adjacent possible entities, real and fictional, dead and alive.
  
  **Stiegler was a bank robber turned philosopher.**
  
  Now it's time for the Postworking Class to get their reparations back from the Dementropire of the 1% and 100 corporations doing 70% of the ecological damage to the planet for 500 years of illegal war crimes and form autonomous Postworkstead anarcho-co-ops, trading and competing for Critical Coin.

  Takeaway: without infrastructural literacy, humans perceive society as an alien predatory jungle, and the majority of them simply just try not to die the next day, and persist in protecting their small hoard of nuts.
  
  There is no huge productive and coordinated effort coming from the population; at this point, they are beaten dogs. BUT; they all have built up rage and stupid, murderous instinct that can be tapped and aimed. Beaten dogs, when they realize they have nothing to lose, will snap and fight to the death.

- ### 5th Wave Wagers Against Waves 1 to 4:
  
  1. Without accounting for the statistical distribution of organizational fagility and planetary tech revealed by the pandemic, **almost every strategy,  inference and desire comprising the 1st to 4th waves is statistically verifiable to be inaccurate, damaging, and entropic.**
  2. There is extremely low organizational capacity and **extremely high availability of planetary tech**, ethically wieldable by a [[polymath]], but also potentially self-teachable by a child within a year.
  3. All the inclusively scalable transformation, in the context of the Left's 50 year long decline and absolutely strategically incorrect retreat and hysteria, is going to come from [[polymath]]-grade intelligence wielding planetary scale tech, **whether it's from a high visibility celebrity, a self-taught tinkerer, or a self-taught child.**
  
  
  
  [[Neganthropology]] Part 2:
  
  4. Due to the constraints and capacities of our short term memory loop, we are technically all 7 seconds away from producing an inclusively scalable planetary scale solution to the eco-social crises.
  5. There's various ways to measure and verify which proposals are closer or farther and to gauge exchange and investment values in relation to 500 years of illegal colonialism.
  6. Either way the process of learning and reflecting or resting is positive. We can make it doubly effective by calling it a protest, or a "Learn-In" or a Postwork Protest. Also, sometimes 5th Wave feminists refer to it as "Invagination".
  7. The process of learning can be split into playful ontologization and healing epistemologization.
  8. These are 2 different economies, but work together to evolve more antifragile, more inclusively scalable and more [[Neganthropic]] societies!

  There's an absolute world of difference between skilled artists (aka a light pusher) and:
  
  1. Neurochemically imbalanced, presocial individuals who need a safe space and therapy.
  2. Hyperrational, specialist, but ironically inaccurate nerds who need life experience, a good kick in the ass, a bag of shrooms and a massage.
  
  How do you tell the difference? Just look at the artistic output. Neurochemically imbalanced individuals f--k up most relations outside of their individual body; hyperrational specialist and inaccurate nerds are 1 trick ponies.
  
  That being said, skilled art production isn't AT ALL worth any stress, it's literally just pushing light around!
  
  You get a much better buzz from shrooms, parties, travelling, fighting and hacking!

  What is good art?
  
  Good art is art that is self-aware that all it is is a system of light pushing itself around in the universe.
  
  Good artists are ones who understand the paradox of this, and don't take it so goddamn seriously!

  Huge f--king thought experiment:
  
  What
  ---
  
  
  
  
  [[Neganthropology]] - as stupid as it gets:
  
  
  1. Each piece of information has either an entropic or [[Neganthropic]] interpretation.
  2. If the interpreter has low skill of interpretation, there is a very low likelihood of them making a [[Neganthropic]] interpretation, but they could.
  3. Every moment is objectively filled with more [[Neganthropic]] possibilities than are imaginable; subjectively, the less interpretive skill the subject has, the less the possibilities perceived.
  
  ---
  
  
  
  Holy grail of education:
  
  1. Redirecting a human from thinking about simply what is given, to accurately perceiving and navigating [[Neganthropic]] possibilities.
  2. Unfortunately, this takes an active imagination in the human.... not really sure what the factor is that switches this on after it's been turned off... shrooms? Truly, shrooms should precede re-education in adults.
  3. For the most part, after age 7, Imagination is vastly reduced.
  
  ---
  
  
  
  
  On [[Neganthropology]] in adults:
  
  1. For most, imagination has been severely reduced after age 7.
  2. All accurate interpretations of boring things like philosophy and statistics actually require imagination.
  3. Really, psychedelics should be a necessity for human adults. It's absolutely stupid to engage with adults on accuracy or art without them tripping.

- ## The Least Stupid Escape Room (the size of the constraints of your subjectivity):
  
  1. Every physical system and piece of information can be positioned either entropically (uninclusive or unscalable) or [[Neganthropic]]ally (inclusively scalable).
  2. There are always exponentially more [[Neganthropic]] (inclusively scalable) solutions than entropic.
  3. Some subjectivities have more inclusively scalable solutions already; it takes more energy to transfer them to other subjectivities (although any can simply teach themselves). This labor should be compensated accordingly by the 1%, who owe everyone reparations for 500 years of colonial war crimes.
