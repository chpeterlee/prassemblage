- # 1. Introduction
	- [[5th Generation Modernism]], a cultural movement related to [[5th Generation Art]], situates itself in a fifth phase of culture following Claire Bishop's four phases of art. This fifth phase of culture takes its ground as the dual dynamic forming the post-pandemic planetary context. 
	  
	  This dual dynamic is composed of systemic fragility due to 1980's neoliberalism and high availability of planetary-scale technologies. It is comprised of 3 primary conceptual dimensions:
		- 1. All entities on Earth are inherently autodidactic components of the [[Autodidactic Universe]], or [[autopoetic]] systems and probabilistically tend towards [[net negentropy]] / [[Antifragility]] / [[Inclusive Scalability]] / [[neganthropy]] over time.
		- 2. The number of unimaginable, unpredictable and unprestateable [[hyperobjects]] of [[Adjacent Possible]] solutions far outnumber the number of known [[hyperobjects]], at any given time.
		- 3. Capacity to produce [[inclusively scalable]] [[Semiotechne]] [[Assemblage]] processes with Earth's subsystems is the horizon to measure the capacity of any subsystem of Earth against.

- 2. Origination Context
	- [[5th Generation Modernism]] is primarily grounded in a post-pandemic awareness of systemic fragility and a high availability of planetary-scale technologies. This ground allows for a re-weighting of existing cultural values and socio-economic relations based on accurate statistical evaluations of infrastructural capacity, potentiality and rarity of [[Antifragility]].
	- [[5th Generation Modernism]] operates in the context of [[5th Generation Revolution]], [[5th Wave Feminism]], [[5th Generation Art]], [[5th Generation Protest]], [[5th Generation Society]], [[5th Generation Writing]], [[5th Generation Warfare]] and [[5th Generation Democracy]].

- # 3. Application Context
	- The higher level of generalization and discretization utilized in [[5th Generation Modernism]] allows for statistically accurate transcultural valuation and arbitration, resolving the inaccurate imbalances of modernism and post-modernism as either iconic or iconoclastic. [[5th Generation Modernism]] is currently deployed in the [[Amasian Biennale (Amasia.live)]] to aid in arbitrating transnational interactions.
