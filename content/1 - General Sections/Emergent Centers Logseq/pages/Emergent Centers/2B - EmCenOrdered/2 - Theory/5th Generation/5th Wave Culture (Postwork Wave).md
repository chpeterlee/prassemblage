- [[5th Wave Culture (Postwork Wave)]]  takes its ground as the dual dynamic forming the post-pandemic planetary context as described by [[5th Generation Revolution]] theory, Claire Bishop's contextualization of the 4 phases of conceptual art in relation to technology and [[Bernard Stiegler]]'s theory of the [[Neganthropocene]] and [[Neganthropology]].
