1. Anti-intellectual, technophobic, emotionalist art to one side.
2. Formalist specialists, both physical and informational, to another.
3. Finally, polymath, inclusively scalable, critical and complex art to the last.                                         Let the exchange value of each be evaluated and transacted accurately." **Antinomy, 2023**










### "Wager from an ethical future version of yourself: Co-signing your present fragility and incapacity is not what your ethical future self would do.", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

1. Already agreed to the right answer layer - fragility, interpassive. 
2. Organizing base layer - global Commons, 3 scales of nonlinear differences.
3. Modelling layer - that's a great model, let's see how it does against others.

**Banana Revolution** starts from the fact that 99% of the adults of the world are permanently 13 years old. 13 year olds are not literate enough for visual art, theory and self-organizing. They must learn through:

1. Music
2. Instruments
3. Fashion

**Warning - extremely complex artecide thought experiment:**

1. 10,000 people who don't know how the planet's core infrastructure fall into a coma tomorrow. Do things collapse and lots of people die? **NO.**
2. 10,000 people who are the core polymaths that operate the planet's infrastructure fall into a coma tomorrow. Do things collapse and lots of people die? **YES.**

Phase 1: produce referents- done.

Phase 2: structure and automate protocols - almost done.

Phase 3:

There could be no bigger disappointment to Nikola Tesla than seeing how much less capacity the planet has now.

Why Hito Steyerl? She can translate for 13 year olds.









## "Inaccuracy, incapacity and inflexibility, the 3 weaknesses of most Gen X art, culture and production.

Most millenial weaknesses: 
1. Psychological fragility
2. Specialization in either informational or technical skill
3. Lack of imagination in invention and/or warfare."

Chongha Peter Lee,  2023






Gen X has 3 weaknesses:
1. Incapacity
2. Inflexibility
3. Inaccuracy

Gen Y has these:
1. Psychological Fragility
2. Illiteracy
3. Inexperience

Chongha Peter Lee will escape both by:
1. Articulating the problems of both.
2. Playfully pointing at the prototype solutions via Banana Revolution, giving people the choice and space to learn them without growing a dependency on him.
3. Gradually only working with polymaths and the rare intelligent and ethical youth (only about 15% of today's youth will be autonomous individuals).

He proposes a deal:
1. Get him to a place where polymaths are.
2. You earn a commission in Criticalcoin.







## "Dude, people are too undereducated, underskilled and underresourced for revolution; BUT NOT BANANA REVOLUTION. " Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

70% of the population was failed through the education system; hence we can't expect emergent movements based on textually, visually and systems-literate individuals. 

1. We have masses of 13 year olds; 13 year olds can follow 3 step instructions.
2. If they don't feel a chemical surge of dopamine, trying something new, they quit in about 7 seconds.
3. Lots of these 13 year olds are going to die of stupidity.
4. All the heavy lifting of actual social change can be done via automation; it's suicide to ask 13 year olds to fix the planet.
5. What 13 year olds can do is make a bunch of noise and draw attention. Not from skill, but from lack thereof - just as teenagers do. Occupy was the best at this. So what we can do is then use 13 year olds like bees to carry the pollen necessary to prevent planetary collapse.
