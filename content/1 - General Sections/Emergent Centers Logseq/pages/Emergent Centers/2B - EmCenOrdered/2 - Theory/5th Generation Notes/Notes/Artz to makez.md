6. Homo[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]][[Neganthropologist]]

- 1.  I came up with this idea of like
	- **Homo Amasiaticus Neganthropologos Invaginus**
	- **[[Dr. Phil I. Stine]]**
	   so it's a human species that's also an anthropologist of neganthropy hahaha    
	   basically by observing itself, it produces itself
	   so like, us "speaking languages" would simultaneously be observed as neganthropological activity, while the neganthroplogical activity would be producing langauge itself
	   it just collapses anthropology basically, i think it would be super funny
	   OH and the last little trick is if we call it
	- **Homo Amasiaticus Neganthropologos Invaginus** hahahaha
	   collapses all the identities
- Call this the Birth of an Invagination
