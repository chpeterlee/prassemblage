The difference between film and video art:

1. The minimum reality unit in film is a frame's worth of time moving in a sequence, even if it's looping in on itself.
2. The minimum unit in video art is a thought, independent of any particular constraint, but also articulated through multiple constraints.

Bet that over time, video art will obsolesce film; why make for a single sequence? So boring!

This is also the weakness of cinema culture; you see 1 frame in a continuous sequence. Apply that now to a massive amount of people acculturated to zoom. Super. Fucking. Boring.







Treepac:

Mainly just spits out simple rules of thumb on how to make things suck a bit less - but doesn't expect the listener to go learn the skills for coding or philostatistics.

Anti-intellectual culture is dead culture; super serious culture is dead culture.
