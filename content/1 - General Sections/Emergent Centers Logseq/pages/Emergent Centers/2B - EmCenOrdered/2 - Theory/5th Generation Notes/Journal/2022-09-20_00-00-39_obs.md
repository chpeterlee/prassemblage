1. Higher bandwidth of complexity.
2. Higher speed of transmission.
3. Capacity to connect and augment older generations of [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]xis and theory.
4. More accuracy and connectivity. 5G Art uses up to 90% less energy, cost and time.
5.  It is also verifiable by human and machine teams utilizing both qualitative metrics and quantitative data.
6. It can translate into existing and speculative cultural forms.
7. It has integrated probabilistic ethics and pre-emptively builds dynamically self-balancing systems.
