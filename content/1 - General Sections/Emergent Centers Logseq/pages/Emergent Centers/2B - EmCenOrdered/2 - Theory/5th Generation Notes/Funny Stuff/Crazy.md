## Got it - this should be simple enough for the Humanities:

Inaccurate Linearity = Fascism, Collapse, Entropy, Boredom, Ugliness

Antifragile [[non-linear]]ity = Inclusivity, Scalable Transformation, Healthy Intersubjectivity, Critical Thinking, Freedom and Constraints.

Anyone know anyone with a wad of dough to pay me for educating the fragile so they don't pay for it?

Centre Pompidou, Jersey City, by any chance? Thanks.

In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]",  2023 society is split into 3 sections:

1. Line-of-sight accurate Postworking Class (9%)
2. Specialists (9.9%)
3. [[polymath]]s (.1%)

Technically, there are only about 7,000 humans who know how to actually operate the planet. The rest are basically pulled by whatever is stimulating their senses the most at any given time, in their line-of-sight.

In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]",  [[Dr. N-1]] recovers a note from [[Elan Semiotechne]] on the Year 2023:

**I will pay the fragile, artists and otherwise, an award, to connect me to antifragile artists.**

In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]",  [[Dr. N-1]] recovers a note from [[Elan Semiotechne]] on the Year 2023:

There's no way in f--k I could possibly work in art or the public sector.  The more inane conversations I have, the worse my migraines get. I am willing to just pay for silence and peace. 

As for actual social change, this is the most effective strategy:

1. Hack everything into equality, forget educating.
2. Wait for stupidity to kill the stupid of natural causes.
3. Make art to connect with the non-stupid and write whitepapers to connect with [[polymath]]s.

The difference in complexity between how a [[polymath]] sees the universe and how a non-[[polymath]] sees the universe is like the difference between walking blindly through a pitch black cave and having a torch.

... no wonder Plato used the cave metaphor.
