  **Why So Meh?** 
  *Chongha Peter Lee*
  ![[Paul_Fermamdez_a_black_and_white_cat_in_a_black_suit_in_a_snowy_82d007e7-dbcd-4c57-9dea-0d57a3cf58cc.png]]
  
  Today, if you can click a few buttons, you can quite easily be a successful cyber criminal or cybersecurity auditor... why are people still robbing each other with guns? Are people this f-cking stupid? I remember robbery used to be for the intelligent. [[Bernard Stiegler]] robbed banks.
  
  There is no market for actual intellectualism, because there is no audience for it; 70% of modern society doesn't know how to do anything other than operate some apps and a spreadsheet. What are people teaching? What are people learning? What do people even want to do with their lives? Do they even ask these questions...? Who killed thought?
  
  Personally I'd just rather wander around cities and beaches with a projector, bottle of wine, a phone and a laptop, writing brilliant articles such as this, and just totally shame boring people.

  70% of people in modern societies are too boring to learn or make anything other than tapping a few app buttons and some speadsheets.
  
  Okay f--k em, I'd rather play with the least boring 30%! 
  
  New game goal: Gather as many least boring people as possible, and do the least boring things.

  Calling all people who aren't boring, checked out zombies!
  
  No skills required, just energy and weirdness and most likely social awkwardness, (because if you have the first 3, the last naturally follows).

  Devil is beaten by Peter by his suicide in precise degrees (setting up for suicide protest), for the good of the planet.

  On this day, Chongha Peter Lee hath epiphanied how to beat the devil for the wager of his soul, life and save the planet simultaneously.
  
  Is he the first conceptual artist to beat the devil or not? LAY YOUR BETS ON [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Bestideas.lol]] !

  4 parts
- Degrees of suicide

- [[Non-binary]] difference. Outcome not process, as long as not prohibited or disastrous
  The last part is the distress call across the ICP. To have faith in humanity. Religious, pop, small-midsize biz.
