# [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]]: 5th Generation Queer Arbitration Artist
[[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] is a [[proxy]] 5th Generation [[0. Personal/Queer Arbitration]] Artist. He uses art to arbitrate across cosmo-political contracts comprising ideologies, knowledge disciplines, technological infrastructures, technologies and socio-economic contexts. He produces [[7 - Art Notebook/5G/5th Generation Art]] who's claims, complexity and valuations can be accurately verified by physicists, philosophers and AI.

Oftentimes, [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]]'s theory and [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]tice utilizes and results in the queering of conceptual and physical structures and processes. He has 2 major political commitments.
# 1. Anti-neoliberal Liberalism:
Anti-neoliberal liberalism refuses:
1. Collective Scale: the budgetary destruction of social protections and services by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980's which cut education budgets by at least 50% and allowed for the privatization of public infrastructure, which resulted in both reduced functional capacity and regional socio-economic insecurities and destabilization. 
2. Ideological: it also refuses inaccurate Marxist conflations of trade, technology, speculation, logics and mathematics with capitalism. 
3. Individual: It also refuses.
	- The engagement of exploitative [[non-linear]] contracts even for "good causes"
	- Stigmatization of proportional non-lethal violence and aggression in self defense
	- Dispute of claims without probabilistic contextualization, verifiable metrics and staking.
	  
	  
	  This drastic distributive shift is held as the primary reason that most modern individual humans are traumatized and incapable of self-organization and balanced, equitable and complex social relations. In addition, it is targeted as the reason that the current technological and knowledge infrastructure is incapable of outputting complex and robust syntheses of novel complexities and inventions.
	  
	  Anti-neoliberal Liberalism embraces and destigmatizes all the individual-psychological scale cultural licenses and hybridization produced throughout time. However it mandates consensus if a practice is scaled beyond a single body.
	  
	  Anti-neoliberal Liberalism compares relations through [[non-linear]] statistical inferential models.
# 2. Post-Work Republican:
Post-Work Republicans embrace a republic built on post-work. Having close ties to individuals who have been either physically or cognitively traumatized and destabilized by Reagan and Thatcher's neoliberal surge in the 1980's, they refuse illusions of a homogenous industrialized society of workers or a homogenous expectation of logic and reason. They embrace social protections, regional market regulatory technology, diversity, complexity and [[Autodidactic]] educational programs on the grounds that fragility and entropy decrease regional socio-economic security and stability.

Post-Work Republicans utilize critical computation and calculation technologies to accurately construct open-ended metrics and frameworks of redistribution. They are conservative on entropy, and prioritize physical health before psychological and subjective states. They demand accuracy from readings of religious text using multiple dimensions of physical, conceptual and eco-social verification. They are open to discussion and adopting new perspectives in terms of accurate calculation of probabilities and concise, logical descriptions of possibilities.

They are open to others [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]cticing cultural [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]ctices that are different from theirs, and will adopt new cultural [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]ctices given time to comprehend the benefits or incentivized to do so. They are both critical of extractive, corporate capital and the 1% and understand the capacity of creative trade, exchange and barter to transform negative eco-social relations.

As such, they endorse Universal Basic Income, Universal Health Care, Arts-based [[Autodidactic]] Education, maximum 20 hour work-weeks, open source infrastructure and regulatory technologies on the 1% and 100 Most Deadly eco-social organizations.
