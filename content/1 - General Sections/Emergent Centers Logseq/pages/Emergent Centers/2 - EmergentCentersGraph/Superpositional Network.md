- # 1. About:
	- The [[Superpositional Network]] is a production, verification and distribution network utilizing the quantum internet and other technologies to rapidly distribute [[Inclusively Scaleable]] systems.
	- The [[Superpositional Network]] operates through 3 layers:
		- [[persistent state]] inference-based partnerships
		- Human-machine teams and proxies
		- Inclusive scalability verified via [[Statistical Review]]
	- The Superpositional Network is a [[persistent state]] [[inferential network]] that uses humans, a network of [[quantum simulator]]'s, and AI connected via [[Web 3+]] to distribute across multiple inferential networks. 
	  
	  The [[inference]]s' accuracy are constantly reweighted towards [[net negentropy]] in a system comprised of humans collaborating with AI parameterized on the latest versions of [[Open Source Universal Basic Intelligence Communities]] [[SRP]] protocol valued against the [[INF]]'s [[Accurate Market]] matrice.
	- 1. Inferential discussions are held across the planet through various networks and platforms. For security reasons, the bulk are not stored directly in this database, but are inferentially linked.

- # 2. Application:
	- Discussions are [[inference]]d into [[Superpositional Network]] members, human and non-human, across the planet, producing a network of [[Grey Papers]] which allow for more accurate [[inference]] of [[net negentropy]] of various scales of the [[Intercity Planetary]] in accordance to the physical rates of change compiled in the [[Open Source Universal Basic Intelligence Communities]]' [[:#[[Intercity Planetary Almanac]]]]. The discussions are [[inference]]d via [[State Space Exhibitions & The Impossible Embassy]] with non-human intelligences aggregating and synthesizing across datasets.

- # 3. Methods
	- Various [[inference]]s, in the form of exhibitions, cinema, essays and documentation are dIstributed via the [[7. Inferential Press Net & [[inference]] Web]].

- 4. Statistical Review & Distribution:
	- Multiple "greylists" are [[inference]]d across the planet via different sections of [[Gen N (Generation Negentropy)]] , to aim proportional social and legal pressures upon negligent individual private and public actors for specific contracts.

- # 5. Metrics & Arbitration:
	- Inferences are weighed against the [[Inclusive Scalability Index]].

			- <<:: **AI Composed Raw Synthesis:** ::>
			- 1. **Capitalism is an in[[accurate]] market dependent on the suppression of information to perpetuate unsustainable inequities.**
			- 2. An [[accurate]] market would require a social floor composed of both private and public organizations producing mixed implementations of universal basic income, health care, arts-based education, infrastructure, maximum 20 hour work-weeks.
			- 3. Only [[3.5%]] of a population is required to make a political change. Different is more.
			- 4. Political change can be rapidly scaled by synthesizing new artistic, philosophical, scientific, technological and cultural tools; there are currently 50 billion bots existing and recently new mixtures of the sciences and humanities have settled questions over a millennia old which allow for a transparent and equitable planetary market.
			- 5. The design and implementation of an [[accurate]] market is worth a minimum of $1 trillion which can be owned as a co-op, producing almost infinite “[[accurate]] Collar” jobs in regional economies producing 80% information and culture, 20% material recombination and measurable endpoints of net zero emissions, 88% equality across the region, and intellectual ecologies which can at minimum produce 1 planetary-scale paradigm shift per 7 years.
