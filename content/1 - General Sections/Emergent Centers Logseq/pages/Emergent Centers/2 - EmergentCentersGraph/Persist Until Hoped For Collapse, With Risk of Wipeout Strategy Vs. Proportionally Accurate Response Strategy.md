- i want to name this idea of like -

- [2:40 PM]

- so basically I think there is maybe an unintentional belief in Progressive thought that constant retreat is a viable strategy (edited)

- [2:41 PM]

- like basically, if a large entity takes things from us, then the response is to evacuate and form a NEW thing (edited)

- [2:42 PM]

- its like a strategy of non-confrontation I believe?

- to me, coming from simplistic studies of warfare, this seems absolutely insane - but I do think it is very much a civilian society belief

- I'm guessing stemming from theories of non-violent social change, Gandhi and etc.

- they would self-organize and produce things like marches and etc. , rather than taking up arms and get crushed (edited)

- If retreat is the only option, then obviously, people run out of territory to retreat to.

- [2:46 PM]

- Of course, I'm also against utilizing strategies in which you have a vast asymmetrical disadvantage or rely on resources we don't have, but for sure, we can throw into a simulator, if the only thing the Left, or whatever band of humans attempting some type of Progressive trajectory does is surrender... it's pretty much easily predictable that we have a quite miserable time ahead of us, simply just waiting for systemic collapse of unsustainable systems....
