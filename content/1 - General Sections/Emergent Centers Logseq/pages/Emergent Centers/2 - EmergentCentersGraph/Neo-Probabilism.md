- 1. Abstract
- Neo-Probabilism is a modern philosophical and ethical theory and art movement that builds upon the foundation of traditional probability theory. The theory is based on three core principles:
	- Probability Principle: The first principle of Neo-Probabilism is that every event has a probability of occurring, which can be expressed as a number between 0 and 1. This principle asserts that events with a higher probability are more likely to occur than events with a lower probability.
	- Accuracy Principle: The second principle of Neo-Probabilism is that every statement has a level of accuracy, which can be expressed as a degree of confidence or probability. This principle recognizes that all statements, including scientific theories and moral judgments, are subject to a degree of uncertainty and should be evaluated based on their level of accuracy.
	- [[Inclusive Scalability]] Principle: The third principle of Neo-Probabilism is that every proposition has more or less inclusive scalability (also known as [[net negentropy]]) for an [[Postwork Majority]] of the planet, verifiable via statistical review. This principle asserts that ethical and moral judgments should be based on their ability to promote inclusive and sustainable systems and processes that benefit a majority of people. This principle recognizes that social, economic, and environmental issues are interconnected and should be evaluated based on their ability to promote [[Inclusive Scalability]].

- 2. Historical Contextualization
- Neo-probabilism can be contextualized within the emerging field of philostatistics, which is an interdisciplinary field that combines philosophy and statistics to develop new methods for analyzing complex social and cultural phenomena. The field is concerned with using statistical methods to evaluate and compare different moral and ethical positions, as well as to assess the impact of social policies on various populations.
- In terms of the history of probability, Neo-probabilism can be seen as building on the philosophical contributions of Leibniz, who was one of the earliest thinkers to develop a systematic approach to probability. Leibniz developed a theory of probability that was based on the concept of "possible worlds," which he defined as all the different ways that events could unfold. He argued that the probability of an event was the ratio of the number of possible worlds in which the event occurs to the total number of possible worlds.
- Like Leibniz, Neo-probabilists recognize that probability is a fundamental aspect of the natural world and that it is essential for understanding complex phenomena. However, Neo-probabilism takes a more empirical approach to probability than Leibniz did, emphasizing the importance of statistical analysis and empirical evidence in evaluating moral and ethical claims.
- One of the earliest precursors to neo-probabilist art is the literary movement known as Oulipo, which was founded in France in 1960. Oulipo writers used various forms of constraints and mathematical models to generate new forms of literature and poetry, often with surprising and unpredictable results. This approach to creativity, which emphasizes the role of chance and contingency, has been a major influence on neo-probabilist artists.
- Another key influence on neo-probabilist art is the work of the composer John Cage, who famously used chance operations and indeterminate methods to create his compositions. Cage's use of chance and randomness as compositional tools, along with his emphasis on the process of creation rather than the finished product, has been a major influence on many neo-probabilist artists.
- In the visual arts, the work of Marcel Duchamp has been a significant influence on neo-probabilist artists. Duchamp's use of found objects and readymades, which often had an element of chance or unpredictability to them, has been an important precursor to the use of probabilistic methods in contemporary art.
- Zen meditation practice s have also had an influence on neo-probabilist art, particularly in their emphasis on the present moment and the unpredictable nature of reality. This influence can be seen in the use of chance and contingency in many neo-probabilist artworks.
- More recently, computer-based artworks, participatory performance artworks, happenings, and action painting have all contributed to the development of neo-probabilist art. These practice s often emphasize the role of the viewer or participant in the creation of the artwork, and frequently incorporate chance or probabilistic elements into the creative process.

- 3. Applications
- Neo-probabilism is essential for understanding and modelling complex systems, such as the Corona virus, as it provides a framework for evaluating and comparing different outcomes and responses. In the case of the Corona virus, understanding the probability of different outcomes (e.g. the likelihood of transmission, mortality rates, etc.) is critical for developing effective public health policies and responses.
- An understanding of probability can also provide psychological, social, and economic benefits for individuals. For example, individuals who are knowledgeable about probability are better equipped to evaluate and compare different options and outcomes, allowing them to make more informed decisions. This can have a positive impact on both their personal and professional lives.
- In addition, an understanding of probability can help individuals to better manage risk, whether it be financial risk or personal risk. By understanding the probabilities of different outcomes, individuals can make more informed decisions about how to allocate their resources and prepare for potential outcomes. This can help to reduce stress and anxiety, as individuals are better prepared for the uncertainties of the future.

- 4. Inferrable Worldview
- Neo-probabilism provides a worldview and outlook for the future that is accurately optimistic based on an objective abundance of the [[Adjacent Possible]]. This means that it recognizes the vast range of potential outcomes and possibilities, and aims to evaluate them based on their probabilities and potential impact. This allows for a more objective and data-driven approach to decision making, which can lead to more successful outcomes.
- In addition, neo-probabilism provides a cultural framework for healing, as it emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and scalability in evaluating and responding to complex systems. This means that it encourages a more holistic and comprehensive approach to problem-solving, which can help to address the root causes of issues and promote sustainable solutions.
- Furthermore, neo-probabilism provides a robust and rigorous set of tools for technical and theoretical discussions. By using probability theory and statistical analysis, it allows for more precise and accurate evaluations of complex systems and their potential outcomes. This can help to facilitate more productive and informed discussions in a variety of fields, from science and technology to economics and politics.

- 5. Methods
- As neo-probabilism is composed of inferences drawn across multiple measuring methods, it is independent of any particular measuring process. It uses multiple measuring methods to triangulate inferences accurately. Some methods are as follows:
- 1. Probabilistic modeling: This involves constructing mathematical models that simulate the behavior of complex systems based on available data. By using statistical analysis and probability theory, probabilistic modeling allows for the identification of patterns and trends in large datasets, as well as the prediction of future outcomes.
- 2. Probabilistic photography: This involves using photographic techniques to capture images that reflect the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability of complex systems. By utilizing techniques such as long exposures and multiple exposures, probabilistic photography can create images that are both abstract and representational, conveying a sense of the complexity and ambiguity of the subject matter.
- 3. Probabilistic architecture: This involves designing buildings and structures that are flexible, adaptable, and resilient in the face of uncertainty and change. By incorporating probabilistic models and data into the design process, probabilistic architecture can create buildings that are responsive to changing environmental conditions and can adapt to evolving social and cultural needs.
- 4. Probabilistic prototyping: This involves creating prototypes of products, services, or systems that are designed to test and refine probabilistic models and predictions. By using feedback from users and stakeholders to refine and improve probabilistic models, probabilistic prototyping can help to ensure that complex systems are robust, adaptable, and effective.
