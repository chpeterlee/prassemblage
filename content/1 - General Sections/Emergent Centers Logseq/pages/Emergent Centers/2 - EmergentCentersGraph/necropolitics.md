	- From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
	- **Necropolitics**Â is the use ofÂ [social and political power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_%28social_and_political%29)Â to dictate how some people may live and how some must die. The deployment of necropolitics creates whatÂ [Achille Mbembe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achille_Mbembe)Â callsÂ __deathworlds__, or "new and unique forms of social existence in which vast populations are subjected to living conditions that confer upon them the status of the living dead."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necropolitics#cite_note-:4-1)Â Mbembe, author ofÂ __[On the Postcolony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Postcolony)__, was the first scholar to explore the term in depth in his 2003 article,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necropolitics#cite_note-mbembe-2)Â and later, his 2019 book of the same name.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necropolitics#cite_note-:4-1)Â Mbembe identifiesÂ [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism)Â as a prime driver of necropolitics, stating thatÂ [racialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racialization)Â people's lives areÂ [systemically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_bias)Â cheapened and habituated to loss.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necropolitics#cite_note-:4-1)Â However, according to an article by Marina Grzinic, necropolitics precisely defines the forms taken by neo-liberal global capitalist cuts in financial support for public health, social and education structures. To her, these extreme cuts present intensive neo-liberal procedures of â€˜rationalizationâ€™ and â€˜civilizationâ€™.Â [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necropolitics#cite_note-3)
