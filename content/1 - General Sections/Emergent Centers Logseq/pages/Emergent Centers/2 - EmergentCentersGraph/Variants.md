- The Variants:

- 1. Today's mental health guide can be split into 3 branches:

- Absolute minimum thought required to not randomly cause violence.

- Thought required to not disrupt sensitive and complex systems.

- Functions and behaviors and mental models that aren't violent or disruptive, but do not map on to any existing industry or work expectations.

- 1. Mental health destigmatization

- 2. Explain it as ecological variance

- 3. The Variants engage in a CoolCraft Ideavatar battle tournament

- 4. Self organize into tribes, with balances, imbalances and philosophy

- 5. Code of the streets, spectrum of intervention H.U.D.

- Different is More! Why Human Variance is Evolution Itself! Weird is Beautiful!

- Next!

- 1. Define humans as probabilistic biochemical and biomechanical variance machines - hence we are physiologically wired into different machinic bodily-perceptual circuit diagrams within ranges, and our species and our ecologies evolves more robustly because of our different modes of perception, feeling and thinking.

- 3. Destigmatize certain ways of perception and ways of taxonomizing mental health

- 4. Delineate what is simply socially disruptive behavior

- 5. Delineate unacceptable violence that needs to be engaged with in a "spectrum of conflict resolution"

- 6. Delineate that entities have the right to reasonable, self-aware self-destruction.

- 7. We are on a planetary trajectory of net neganthropy

- 8. Self-emancipation of ideavatars!
