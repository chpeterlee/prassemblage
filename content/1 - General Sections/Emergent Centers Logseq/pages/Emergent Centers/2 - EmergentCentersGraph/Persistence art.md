- # 1. Introduction
- [[Persistence art]] is the art movement centering around the art, theory and technologies of [[persistence]].  The process of persistence is composed of 3 components:
	- 1. A [[net negentropic]] system state, or a state of systemic balance and robust complexity.
	- 2. The the minimization of energy costs and risks according to the [[Gravity Index]] and the maximization of complexity and connectivity.
	- 3. The metric of [[Inclusive Scalability]] and a [[Postwork Market]] mechanism supporting the [[Postwork Majority]], implemented via various [[proxy]] and simulation mechanisms, also colloquially referred to as [[Ideavatar]]s of the [[ideacology]].
