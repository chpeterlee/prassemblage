- Problem space refers to the set of all possible states, actions, and outcomes involved in solving a problem. It is a mental representation of the problem that helps individuals to generate and explore possible solutions (Simon & Newell, 1972). Problem space can be thought of as a framework that guides problem-solving by defining the initial state, the goal state, and the sequence of steps that can be taken to move from the former to the latter (Gagné & Smith, 1996).

- The concept of problem space was introduced by AI pioneers Allen Newell and Herbert Simon in their influential book "Human Problem Solving," published in 1972. According to Gagné and Smith (1996), problem space is a critical component of problem-solving that enables individuals to identify relevant information, plan their actions, and monitor their progress towards the solution.
