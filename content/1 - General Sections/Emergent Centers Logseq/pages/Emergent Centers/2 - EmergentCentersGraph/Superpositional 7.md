- The [[Superpositional 7]] is an exhibition of 7 contemporary artists who are producing quantum-aware culture.

- The exhibition takes place across the darkweb, lightweb and various art and alternate reality games which continuously exhibit according to the fundamental principle of quantum logic; thus each work is installed at a site where a viewer is not looking. A non-represented component of the work can be deduced either through it's absence or presence.

- This will serve as an open-ended framework for other projects to interact with and solidify an intellectual core that can transparently direct action to resolve the ecosocial crises and extend the horizon of the planet's imaginable lifespan beyond solar change, the point in time in 600 million years when the sun heats up and collapses the planet surface ecology's ability to perform photosynthesis. The solution to this is already written, it's quite simple to develop over a period of a decade or less, and quite possible to build it by 2100.
