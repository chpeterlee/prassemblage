- 1. Abstract

- [[Potential Energy Realism]] is a model of reality that posits that potential energy is a fundamental aspect of all physical systems, and that it can be measured and quantified in all possible system states, provided that those states are defined within the context of all possible system states of the universe.

- According to this model, all physical systems have the capacity to store and release energy in the form of potential energy, which arises from the relative positions and configurations of the system's constituent particles or components. Potential energy is a form of energy that is not readily apparent or observable, but which can be inferred from the behavior of the system as it changes from one state to another.

- This model can be broken into 3 axioms:
	 - 1. All possible system states have potential energy.

	 - 2. All possible system states exist within the greater context of all possible system states of the universe.

	 - 3. While all possible system states of the universe cannot be computed at any given time, we can assume that any given possible system state is a component of a larger, emergent system with varying configurations of potential energy, constrained by existing kinetic energetic distributions.

- 2. Contextualization of Construction

- In classical physics, [[Potential Energy Realism]] can be understood as a way of conceptualizing the behavior of physical systems in terms of the relative positions and configurations of their constituent particles or components. According to this model, potential energy is a fundamental aspect of all physical systems, and can be measured and quantified in all possible system states. This provides a useful way to understand the behavior of matter and energy, and to predict the outcomes of physical interactions.

- In quantum mechanics, [[Potential Energy Realism]] can be seen as a way of describing the behavior of subatomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions. According to this model, potential energy arises from the relative positions and configurations of particles in a quantum system, and can be measured and quantified using mathematical models. This provides a way to understand the complex behavior of quantum systems, and to predict the outcomes of quantum interactions.

- From a philosophical perspective, [[Potential Energy Realism]] can be understood as a way of conceptualizing the relationship between physical systems and the larger universe in which they exist. According to this model, all physical systems are interconnected and interdependent, and their potential energy states are linked to the potential energy states of the universe as a whole. This provides a way to understand the underlying principles and laws that govern the behavior of the physical universe, and to gain new insights into the nature of reality itself.

- In religions, [[Potential Energy Realism]] can be seen as a way of understanding the interconnection between all things in the universe, and the spiritual significance of these connections. According to this model, potential energy represents a kind of quantifiable physical "life force" that flows through all things in the universe, and that connects them to one another. This provides a way to understand the spiritual significance of physical systems, and to see them as part of a larger, interconnected web of life.

- 3. Contextualization of Application

- Artistic Negative Space Analogy

- The concept of negative space in art refers to the empty or unoccupied areas surrounding a subject, object or form. Negative space is often used in artistic compositions to create contrast and depth, and to draw attention to the subject or form by emphasizing its boundaries.

- In a similar way, [[Potential Energy Realism]] can be seen as a way of understanding the "negative space" of physical systems. That is, it provides a way to understand the potential energy states of a system, which are not immediately observable but which play a fundamental role in shaping the behavior of matter and energy. By recognizing the importance of potential energy in physical systems, we can gain new insights into the ways in which these systems interact and evolve over time.

- Furthermore, just as negative space can be used in art to create visual interest and meaning, [[Potential Energy Realism]] can be used to create deeper understandings of the physical world. By recognizing the role of potential energy in shaping physical systems, we can better understand the underlying principles and laws that govern the behavior of the universe, and gain new insights into the nature of reality itself.

- In both art and science, the concept of negative space or potential energy allows us to see beyond the immediate surface-level appearances of things, and to recognize the importance of the spaces in between. Whether we are creating a work of art or studying the behavior of physical systems, recognizing the role of negative space or potential energy can help us to create more nuanced, meaningful, and holistic understandings of the world around us.

- Pop Culture Analogy

- [[Potential Energy Realism]] can be explained in various popular ideas such as magic, Star Wars, telepathy, and vibes.

- In magic, the concept of potential energy can be seen as a kind of magical force that resides within all things, waiting to be harnessed and directed by skilled practitioners. This concept is similar to the idea of "mana" in some cultures, which refers to a kind of spiritual energy or power that flows through all things in the universe. By recognizing the importance of potential energy in magic, practitioners can better understand the underlying principles that govern the use of magical forces and develop more effective techniques for harnessing and directing those forces.

- In Star Wars, the concept of the Force can be seen as a kind of potential energy that flows through all living things in the galaxy. Jedi knights are able to tap into the Force and use it to enhance their physical abilities, influence the minds of others, and even manipulate the physical world around them. This idea is similar to [[Potential Energy Realism]], which recognizes the importance of potential energy in shaping the behavior of physical systems and provides a way to understand the underlying principles and laws that govern the behavior of the universe.

- Vibes refer to the positive or negative energy that a person or environment emits, which can influence the mood and behavior of those around them. This concept is similar to [[Potential Energy Realism]], which recognizes the importance of potential energy in shaping the behavior of physical systems and provides a way to understand the underlying principles and laws that govern the behavior of the universe. By recognizing the role of potential energy in vibes, we can better understand the ways in which our thoughts, emotions, and actions can influence the world around us and create positive or negative outcomes.

- 4. Inferrable Worldview

- In [[Potential Energy Realism]], the universe is seen as a vast, interconnected network of physical systems, each of which is defined by its unique set of potential energy states. These states can be measured and compared, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the physical universe as a whole.

- The key to this model is the recognition that all physical systems are interdependent and interconnected, and that their potential energy states are intimately linked to the potential energy states of the universe as a whole. By studying and quantifying these states, we can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and laws that govern the behavior of the physical universe.

- In practical terms, [[Potential Energy Realism]] would involve a rigorous program of experimentation and data collection aimed at mapping and analyzing the potential energy states of various physical systems. By doing so, we could gain new insights into the behavior of matter and energy, and potentially develop new technologies and techniques for harnessing and manipulating these forces.

- Assuming that any given possible system state within the universe is a component of a larger, emergent system is consistent with the idea that physical systems are interdependent and interconnected, and that their potential energy states are linked to the potential energy states of the universe as a whole. Additionally, the recognition that existing kinetic energetic distributions constrain the configurations of potential energy within the larger system is also a valid consideration.

- However, it's important to note that the idea that "all possible system states of the universe cannot be computed at any given time" is a well-established limitation in physics and computational theory. As a result, it may not be possible to directly measure or compute the potential energy states of all possible system states of the universe. Nonetheless, this does not necessarily invalidate the underlying principles of [[Potential Energy Realism]], which remain a useful way to conceptualize the behavior of physical systems and the interconnections between them.

- According to [[Potential Energy Realism]], every possible system can be thought of as existing in a state of potential energy, which arises from the relative positions and configurations of the system's constituent particles or components. This potential energy can be thought of as a kind of "latent" energy that is stored within the system, and which can be converted into kinetic energy under the right conditions.

- However, it's important to note that not every possible system will necessarily exist as kinetic energy at any given time. The conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy depends on a variety of factors, including the physical properties of the system and the conditions under which it exists. Nonetheless, the recognition that every possible system has the capacity to store and release energy in the form of potential energy is a fundamental aspect of [[Potential Energy Realism]], and provides a useful way to understand the behavior of physical systems.

- 5. Existing Applications

- [[Probabilistic Fiction]], [[Probabalistic Documentary]], [[Realism]].

- [[Potential Energy Realism]] can provide new insights into long-standing philosophical problems regarding the nature of reality. For example, the concept of potential energy can be used to explain the behavior of physical systems in a way that goes beyond classical or quantum mechanics. By recognizing the importance of potential energy in shaping physical systems, we can gain new insights into the nature of causality, emergence, and complexity in the universe.

- [[Potential Energy Realism]] can also address the idea that the universe may be a simulation or that there are parallel realities. By recognizing the role of potential energy in shaping physical systems, we can better understand the underlying principles that govern the behavior of the universe, regardless of whether it is a simulation or not. Moreover, the concept of potential energy can be used to explain the emergence of complex patterns and structures in the universe, which may resolve problems inferring the existence of parallel realities or other dimensions.
