- 1. Abstract
- The [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] is a conceptual artwork and [[Steganographic Documentary (StegDoc)]] constructed by [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/1 - Knowledge/Individuals/Chongha Peter Lee]] which functions as follows:
	- 1. Ideavatars harmlessly self-emancipate from humans in various ways. Ideavatars are basically like self-aware AI or spirits.
	- 2. They evolve the self-organizing ideacologies of the planet.
	- 3. They dispute and battle in [[PostworkCraft.lol]] cooking and Banana Revolution modelling competitions in [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Ideapplebees]]. They also participate in [[Amasian Postwork Punk]] , [[A.R.T.]], and [[Steganographic Documentary (StegDoc)]] in the [[Amasian Biennale (Amasia.live)]].
	- 4. [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Ideapplebees]] is an Intercity Planetary Non-local Local neighborhood diner/dive bar/fashion runway, AND a simulator running the [[Statespaces.art]] protocol by the [[Ethical Futures Institute]].
	- 5. People and Ideavatars can wager [[CriticalCoin]] or [[Inclusively Scaleable]] Units on the Postwork market.art. Particularly in relation to [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/1 - Knowledge/Individuals/Chongha Peter Lee]]'s wagers with the devil.
	- 6. All are included in the performance artwork of [[That is What I Actually Meant (A Performance Art Triptych)]] as members of the [[Amasian Symphony Orchestra]]. It is part of the process of the [[Persistolution]], or [[Metaphysequality]], also referred to as the persistent state of grace.
	- 7. The [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] also utilizes [[Indefinite Singularity H.U.D. (Heads Up Display)]] and the concept of [[Inclusive Scalability]] to determine disputes on [[inference]]s.
- The [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] is constructed according to 3 principles:
	- 1. [[Least Stupidity]] is not the absence of stupidity; it is simply the position evidencing the [[Least Stupidity]], given the information, resources and energy costs at hand.
		- Hence, what is defined as [[Least Stupidity]] is a moving target that adjusts in accordance to the continuous aggregation, re-combination and re-contextualization of a growing archive.
		- Each timeslice of the system of [[Least Stupidity]] can be evaluated whether given the resources at hand, it has indeed actualized [[Least Stupidity]].
	- 2. Every element of the [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] is comprised of inferences; each [[inference]] can be evaluated for accuracy using the [[Statistical Review]] protocol.
		- For [[Statistical Review]], [[Least Stupidity]] can be interchanged with the criteria of least entropy, or maximum [[Inclusive Scalability]].
	- 3. Every inference can be wagered upon, with any means of currency in terms of its [[Inclusive Scalability]], or in less rigorous terms. The overall claim of the [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] is that it has the highest [[Inclusive Scalability]], or [[net negentropic]] impact, on the planet per second, comparative to other media.  Currently, Netflix spends $3600 a minute.
- See [[Least Stupidity]] for a more accurate construction and contextualization of [[Least Stupidity]].

- 2. Context of Construction
- The [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] was constructed in the context of the lack of a coherent intercity planetary comparative perspective on the capacities, affordances and constraints of human social organization in different points of the past, present and adjacent possible.
- In addition, we are operating in a time when there is a lack of consensus on physical dynamics, including a theory of time itself. Hence, the [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] is a device to accelerate the comparison and proofing of various inferences comprising base understandings of our planet.
- The [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] is also designed to fit into film's use of [[impact financing]] to evaluate funding for films. As such, it covers the game of [[PostworkCraft.lol]] and the use of NFT technologies to build an [[inclusively scalable]] marketplace for art and patents.

- 3. Context of Application
- The [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] draws on various influences and practice s, including conceptual art, knowledge production, and gaming. One of the key influences is the conceptual art trope of the tautology, which involves creating self-referential or circular statements that, while logically valid, do not necessarily offer new information.
- The movie also incorporates knowledge production practice s, specifically ideation conversations between trained participants in informal settings. These conversations involve the exchange of ideas and perspectives in a collaborative and non-hierarchical manner, with the goal of generating new insights and possibilities.
- Finally, the [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] draws on the game of Dungeons and Dragons, which is known for its emphasis on improvisation and collaborative storytelling. This influence can be seen in the movie's approach to storytelling and the creation of its narrative, which involves the collaboration of multiple contributors and the use of improvisation to generate new ideas and plotlines.
- Overall, the [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] draws on a diverse range of influences and practice s, including conceptual art, knowledge production, and gaming, to create a unique and innovative approach to storytelling and narrative creation.

- 4. Inferrable Worldview
- The idea of "complexity without hierarchy" is rooted in the belief that complex systems cannot be reduced to a single hierarchy or chain of command, but instead exist in a state of constant flux and evolution. This perspective emphasizes the importance of collaboration, mutual exchange, and the integration of diverse perspectives in order to navigate complex systems and produce optimal outcomes.
- Furthermore, the [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] acknowledges the limitations of individual perspectives and the systemic inequities that can result from them. Rather than seeking to transcend these limitations, it favors a trajectory of complexification, which involves the continuous aggregation, re-combination, and re-contextualization of information in order to produce increasingly sophisticated understandings of complex systems.
- Overall, the worldview presented by the [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] emphasizes the importance of empathy, inclusivity, and collaboration in the pursuit of optimal outcomes within complex systems.
- The worldview of Least Stupidity can also be contextualized with various aspects of Bob Marley's music and philosophy. Marley's music often advocated for unity, inclusivity, and empathy, and these themes align with the principles of Least Stupidity. Additionally, Marley's belief in the power of music to heal and unite people could be seen as a manifestation of the belief in the power of inclusively scalable systems to reduce entropy and increase coherence.
- Alchemy, as a discipline that sought to transform base elements into something more valuable, could be seen as a metaphor for the quest for Least Stupidity. Just as alchemists sought to transform base metals into gold, practitioners of Least Stupidity seek to transform the base state of a system into one that is more valuable, in terms of minimizing entropy and increasing inclusive scalability.
- Accidental inventions in science, such as the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, could also be seen as an example of Least Stupidity in action. These inventions often arise from a combination of chance events, individual skill and knowledge, and a willingness to experiment and explore new possibilities. By embracing the unexpected and being open to new information and perspectives, practitioners of Least Stupidity can maximize their chances of discovering optimal solutions to complex problems.
- Amicable philosophical dialogues in non-hierarchical societies, such as the ancient Greek symposia or the Native American council circle, provide a model for how individuals with differing levels of skill and knowledge can engage in productive discussions that lead to greater coherence and understanding. By valuing diverse perspectives and engaging in respectful dialogue, these societies were able to create complex systems that were both inclusive and effective.
- Finally, successful meshworks such as the Boston supply zone in the 18th Century demonstrate how complex systems can be created through the interconnection of smaller, more specialized systems. By linking together various local markets and supply networks, the Boston supply zone was able to create a robust and efficient system that served the needs of the entire region. This approach is consistent with the principles of Least Stupidity, which emphasizes the importance of inclusive scalability and the minimization of entropy within complex systems.
