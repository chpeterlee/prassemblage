- Why is cosmopolitical protest, aka a "Learn-In" a 5th Generation Revolutionary method?

- 1. 50 years after neoliberal warfare, cuts to education and social services, the majority of modern societies are incapacitated to the point that there is a massive production of cognitively impaired individuals who never received adequate support to develop into autonomous, autodidactic individuals.

- 2. We have to conceive of this time where the capacity of human self-organization is at an all time low; this is actually a foundational assumption of 5th Generation Revolution. Capacity has dramatically decreased over the last 50 years, due to insufficient momentum to combat capitalist predations and deteriorating infrastructure.

- 3. Simultaneously, the technological capacity has grown exponentially to the point where you can have super-empowered individuals and small groups gaining control of entire regions or systems, without permissions. The planet's infrastructure is doubly vulnerable due to the incapacitation of the majority of its humans, both with and without.

- 4. Hence it is best to draw an accurate frame around the actual problem: the majority of the planet's populations, both with and without power are quite simply illiterate and inaccurate in relation to its mechanisms. The problem is illiteracy and inaccuracy.

- 5. Most likely, most are too traumatized to learn at this moment. Hence why we need to couple the processes of learning with accurate automated advocacy. Then, whilst the humans are exploring their process, the technological systems simply balance the planet.
