- [[net negentropy]], [[net negentropic]] or [[net neganthropic]] describes the state of a system in which it produces more negentropy than entropy.

	- A simple heuristic is to consider the scale of a system, then the cost/effect ratio (also known as [[Antifragility]]) which can be described through these parameters:
		- Energy/matter/info/time costs.
		- Connectivity, difficulty of compressing diversity and fluidity of synthesis.
