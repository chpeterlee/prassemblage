- [[Antifragile Peace]] is a conception of peace based on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s concept of [[Perpetual Peace]] and [[Nassim Taleb]]'s concept of antifragility. Antifragile Peace uses [[Complexity Science]] to redefine peace as a [[net negentropic]] steady state comprised of probabilistic functions in a dynamic balance.
