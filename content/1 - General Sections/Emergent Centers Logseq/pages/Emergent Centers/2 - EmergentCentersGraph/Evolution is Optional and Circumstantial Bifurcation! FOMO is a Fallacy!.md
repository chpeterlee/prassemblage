- 1. The human brain is 80% designed simply to handle gross physical locomotion - walking.

- 2. It is 100% poorly designed to handle maneuvering abstract symbols. 

- 3. Tragically, if a human is better at handling abstract symbolic systems, it will be able to execute more complex physical tasks.

- 4. So a future human would actually be antagonistic to its previous physical design; it would be able to use its brain, designed for walking, to execute more complex tasks of abstraction to be able to execute more complex physical tasks.

- 5. Note that this has NOTHING to do with accumulation of capital or domination; this is simply the progression of the mechanics of the physical systems of our body that we inherited. In an absolutely fucked up paradox, we are pulled towards something we aren't designed for - thinking. At the same time, this capacity to think is what allowed us to self-organize into our current constraints and systems. 

- 6. Evolution is comprised not of mass transformations, but bifurcations of novel differentiations using pre-existing components. Hence, it is not necessary to erase the past, nor is it necessary to cling to a prior mode. Evolution is optional and anyone can choose it at any moment.

- 7. Also, there's literally 10^10 the amount of opportunities to evolve growing every light speed second. FOMO is stupid, also from the very logic that evolution is bifurcation! if you get bored of one bifurcation, hop on another!!
