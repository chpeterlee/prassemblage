- The [[Inferential Gaze]] refers to the fact that all [[photon]] sensing mechanisms are comprised of inferential systems which obey the universe's probabilistic tendency, or [[negentropy]] over an arbitrary timescale.
  
  Every photon is in the process of [[Quantum Invagination]] which occurs at a minimum speed of: 3 x 10^10 per second.
  
  During the process, it is possible for any possible photon to trigger [[False vacuum decay]] which would collapse the entire universe at light speed.
  
  Hence the continued presence of a single photon of light is proof that there is a "[[ESTA the Intercity Planetary Guardian Angelfluencer, Buddha and General Intelligence, Heartbettor, Negentropic Compass.]]" within each part of the universe that prevents its collapse and steers it towards [[net negentropy]], producing complexification over time.
