- If i was going to give like a bulletpoint it would be like:

1. Aggressive military actions and proxy wars were used to secure unfair trade agreements internationally.
2. Simultaneously, there was a slashing of support for social programs inside nation-states.
3. There was a lot of deregulation to allow for corporate wealth consolidation.
4. Simultaneously, there was a privatization of infrastructure and public institutions - like schools and academies
5. Lots of misinformation was propagated, there was a strategic demonization of certain cultures and populations and the incentivization of disorganization and resistance.
6. This resulted in the psychologization of infrastructural problems, and the infrastucting of a psychological regulatory apparatus. (edited)

- 7. What very few talk about was that pretty much all the major issues that we are facing today were foundationally resolved in the 1970's-80's... just a massive PR campaign of misinformation and the disincentivization of an infrastructure of resistance and the low dissemination of the skills and resources required to do so.

- 8. So what I would posit are the differences today:
- massive new technological spread
- some really cool media culture that is compressed faster than ever, more lateral movement, but this also has its down-sides - like distraction to the point of disintegration.
- from my understanding it's actually possible to have "superusers" of planetary infrastructure that can just bypass any possible permissions process required from institutions to device level. There is a strain in Marxist discourse regarding "General Intelligence" which brushed on this possibility.
- Automation & public imagination and arbitration can happen at a massive scale - that wasn't possible before. So to me this is really an interesting part. We can rapidly propose and discern and sort through possibilities in a way that wasn't possible before.
- Automating recursive compensation for both culture and currency - so we can fix the disincentivization problem without requiring massive and complex legal shifts.
