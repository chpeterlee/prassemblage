- # 1. Introduction
	- [[Semiotechne]] is a concept used in [[5th Generation Art]] used to refer to both physical and informational tools that drive [[inclusively scalable]] [[evolution]]. It is a core concept of [[ecocyber-positivity]]

- 2. Technical Dimensions
	- 1. [[Bernard Stiegler]]'s dynamics of [[Grammatization]] and [[Exteriorization]]; [[Erwin Schrodinger]]'s dynamics of [[entropy extraction]] and [[negentropic modelling]].
	- 2. This proposes how evolution is affected by probabilistic physio-inferential systems, particularly the function of speculation, also colloquially known as imagination. This augments understandings of evolution as a process of blind emergence and also can explain the non-linearity of bifurcations or [[cladogenesis]].
	- 3. Thus, information is understood as a process that is product-agnostic; recomposing given components into assemblages, as theorized by [[Manuel DeLanda]]. Processes can be assemblaged from various products; products are comprised of processes transforming over time.
	- 4. This also implies a new paradigm of causality, in which a system, or statistical models, or an [[attractor]], composed of varying degrees of complexity (measurable via [[Assembly Index]]), can be seen as a perspective that is acting as an axis assembling pre-existing components.
	- 5. Finally, we pose the principle of [[neganthropy]], also referred to as the [[Universal Attractor]] to be the ultimate horizon of [[attractor]]s.
- Notes
	- Grammatization from [[Bernard Stiegler]] is a primary concept of semiotechne with a dual articulation:
		- 1. Describing how semiotics are constrained through technological processes.
		- 2. Describing how material processes can be structed into informational machines.
		- 3. Semiotechnics are the intertwined processes that shape the limits of the possibility spaces of politics, society and evolution.
		- 4. Semiotechnics are typically oppressed by institutional controls and provincial populists.
		- 5. The solution is obviously - use art to teach future culture, hacking to skim the idiots.

		- 2 layers: signs - an interchangeable sign surface which can be swapped out ; and an index pointing to a physical or informational system comprised of constraints, functions, capacities and affordances, which has a minimum reality unit of potential energy.
		- The system itself can be middleware which is also comprised of signs to varying degrees, acting as routers and switches for functions comprising system states.
