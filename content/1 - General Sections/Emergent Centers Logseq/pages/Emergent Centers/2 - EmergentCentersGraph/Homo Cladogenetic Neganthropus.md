- Homo Cladogenetic Neganthropus is a species of humans which evolves by simply continuously splitting and bifurcating from existing species of humans towards increased antifragility and neganthropy. Bifurcations are driven by individuals but resources are drawn and coordinated from collective networks.
- As the primary mechanism of evolution is via splitting, or cladogenesis, towards a novel neganthropic system state - even from a prior system state of itself - this human does not engage in the labor of homogenizing its ancestors, nor does it stupidly just destroy other diverse speciation.
- Homo Cladogenetic Neganthropus simply forges ahead, utilizing both given and potential capacities and affordances sustainably to bifurcate into the next neganthropic system state. Part of this is forming equitable and complementary trade systems with prior, present and potential bifurcations and speciations of humans/ecologies.
- Hence, while Homo Cladogenetic Neganthropus  is driven by a paradigm of an individual-first strategy, it is inherently a collective activity because it requires the meshing and coordination of resources and entities past, present and potential.
- Each transaction of the Homo Cladogenetic Neganthropus can be triangulated according to the [[Assembly Index]], [[Gravity Index]] and [[Preventable Death Index]] .
