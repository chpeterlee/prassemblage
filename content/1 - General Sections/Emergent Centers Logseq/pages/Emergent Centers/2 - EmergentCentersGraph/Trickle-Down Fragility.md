- [[Trickle-Down Fragility]] relates to the lasting effects of the 1980's neoliberal warfare and education and social services budget cuts which have been starkly illuminated from the pandemic. This has resulted in 3 strata:
	 - 1. A concentration of power and wealth into the 1%, who own 50% of the planet's assets, and 100 corporations who are doing 70% of the ecological damage to the planet.

	 - 2. A fragileconomy, comprised of underededucated, deskilled and unethical specialists and entrepreneurs who are incapable of synthesizing [[inclusively scalable]] frameworks at larger scales and are constantly predated upon by larger capital entities.

	 - 3. A working class population that is too exhausted and overworked to demand sufficient resources.
