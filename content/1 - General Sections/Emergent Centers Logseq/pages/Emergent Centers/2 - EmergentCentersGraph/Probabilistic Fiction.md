- 1. Abstract
- "[[Probabilistic Fiction]]" refers to the creation of hypothetical scenarios that are designed to explore and test the probabilistic nature of different conditions, constraints and outcomes of systems. These scenarios are used to create models and simulations that can help individuals and organizations make better decisions based on a more accurate understanding of the likelihood of different outcomes.

- 2. Context of Construction
- In this sense, the term "model" is used broadly to refer to any speculative system of propositions that attempts to describe or predict a complex system. This includes everything from mathematical models used in physics to conceptual models used in architecture or fashion. By using [[Probabilistic Fiction]] to create models that are based on empirical data and statistical analysis, particpants can offer rigorous and scientifically valid approaches to understanding complex systems and making informed decisions based on that understanding.

- 3. Context of Application
- [[Probabilistic Fiction]] is a genre of fiction that uses probabilistic reasoning as a central theme or plot device. It is often associated with hard science fiction and speculative fiction, which also explore scientific and technological concepts in a fictional setting. However, [[Probabilistic Fiction]] has also been explored in artistic experimentation, philosophical thought experiments, and popularization of mathematical and logical paradoxes and problems through metaphor.
- [[Probabilistic Fiction]] in Fiction, Poetry, Philosophy and Math
	- One of the earliest examples of [[Probabilistic Fiction]] is "The Foundation" series by Isaac Asimov, which explores the concept of psychohistory, a fictional field of mathematics that allows the prediction of future events through the analysis of large amounts of data. The series deals with the idea that humans can be treated as statistical aggregates, and their actions can be predicted through probabilistic reasoning.
	- Another notable work in the genre is "The Martian" by Andy Weir, which explores the probabilistic challenges faced by an astronaut stranded on Mars. The story is a demonstration of how probabilistic thinking can be used to solve complex problems in extreme situations.
	- In the realm of artistic experimentation, the work of Oulipo, a group of French writers and mathematicians, is significant. They explored the potential of using constraints in literature and mathematical techniques to generate new forms of creative writing. Their work often involved probabilistic thinking, such as Raymond Queneau's "Cent mille milliards de po√®mes," which consists of ten sonnets with interchangeable lines, allowing for a total of 10^14 possible poems.
	- In philosophical thought experiments, probabilistic reasoning has been used to explore questions of ethics and morality. One example is the "Trolley Problem," which presents a scenario where a person must choose between allowing a trolley to run over five people or diverting it to run over one person. The problem raises questions about the ethics of making decisions based on probabilities and the value of individual lives.
	- Finally, probabilistic thinking has been popularized through metaphorical use of mathematical and logical paradoxes and problems, such as the Monty Hall problem or the Prisoner's Dilemma. These problems have been used in popular culture to explore concepts such as trust, cooperation, and decision-making under uncertainty.
- [[Probabilistic Fiction]] In Art
	- [[Probabilistic Fiction]] has had a significant impact on many different art movements and practice s throughout history, including Fluxus, conceptual art, participatory art, and generative art.
	- Fluxus was a multidisciplinary movement that emerged in the 1960s, which sought to break down the boundaries between art and everyday life. Many Fluxus artists employed chance operations and probabilistic methods in their work, drawing on the ideas of John Cage and other avant-garde artists of the time. For example, George Brecht's "Water Yam" (1963) is a box filled with index cards, each of which contains a single instruction or concept. The user is invited to randomly select cards from the box and use them as prompts for creative activities or actions.
	- Conceptual art, which emerged in the 1960s and 70s, also often utilized probabilistic methods. For example, Sol Lewitt's "Sentences on Conceptual Art" (1969) includes statements such as "Ideas can be works of art; they are in a chain of development that may eventually find some form" and "The artist may not necessarily understand his own art". These statements are presented in a random order, and the reader is invited to assemble them into their own narrative.
	- The I-Ching, a Chinese divination system, has also been a significant influence on [[Probabilistic Fiction]] and art. The I-Ching is based on the idea that the universe is constantly in a state of change, and that this change can be predicted and influenced through the interpretation of randomly generated hexagrams. Many artists have used the I-Ching as a way to introduce chance and randomness into their work, including John Cage and Brian Eno.
	- Participatory art, which involves audience participation and interaction, has also often employed probabilistic methods. For example, Yoko Ono's "Cut Piece" (1964) involved the artist sitting still while members of the audience were invited to approach her and cut off a piece of her clothing. The specific actions taken by each participant were unpredictable and could not be fully controlled by the artist, introducing an element of chance into the performance.
	- Generative art, which utilizes algorithms and computer programs to create art, has also been heavily influenced by probabilistic methods. For example, Lev Manevich's "Random Seed" (2016) is a generative artwork that generates different visual patterns based on a randomly generated seed number. The outcome of the artwork is unpredictable and varies each time it is generated.
	- Overall, [[Probabilistic Fiction]] and art have been used in a variety of ways throughout history to introduce chance and unpredictability into artistic practice s, breaking down boundaries between art and everyday life, and encouraging audience participation and interac

- 4. Inferrable Worldview
- [[Probabilistic Fiction]] offers a unique worldview that combines both wonder and caution. On the one hand, it values the power of open-minded imagination and intelligence to explore and understand the world around us. It recognizes that the universe is full of possibilities and that we can use our creativity and curiosity to discover new and exciting things.
- At the same time, [[Probabilistic Fiction]] is grounded in the wisdom that the universe is ultimately incomputable, undecideable, and self-organizing. It acknowledges that we can never know everything and that there will always be a level of unpredictability and uncertainty in the world.
- However, [[Probabilistic Fiction]] also recognizes that there is grace, unimaginable good, and love statistically prevailing in the long run. By exploring different outcomes and possibilities, it allows us to see that even in the face of uncertainty and chaos, there is still the potential for positive outcomes and a brighter future.
- Overall, [[Probabilistic Fiction]] encourages us to embrace both the wonder and caution in the world around us. It reminds us to be curious and imaginative, but also to be aware of the limitations of our knowledge and the unpredictable nature of the [[Autodidactic Universe]].

- 5. Existing Applications
- [[Probabilistic Fiction]] is an optional methodology employed in the [[Amasian Biennale (Amasia.live)]], [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/5 - Organizations/Entities/Neganthropocene Summit]] and the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/5 - Organizations/Entities/We Have a Transnational Dream]]. Many of the adopted constraints of [[Probabilistic Fiction]] are adapted from the [[Neo-Probabilism]] philosophy, science and art movement.
- In more popular culture, [[Probabilistic Fiction]] is a framework of production used in the [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]], which also works in elements of the genre [[Steganographic Documentary (StegDoc)]] and its parent genre [[Probabilistic Documentary (ProbDocs)]]. The elements of [[Probabilistic Fiction]] are most prominent in the sections of the [[Least Stupid Movie - Different is More]] titled [[The Devil Went Down to Amasia]], in which conceptual artist [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/1 - Knowledge/Individuals/Chongha Peter Lee]] bets the devil that he can save the planet via conceptual art.
