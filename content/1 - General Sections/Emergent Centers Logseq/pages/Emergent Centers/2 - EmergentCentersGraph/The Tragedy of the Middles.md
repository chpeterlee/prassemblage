- [[The Tragedy of the Middles]] refers to the phenomena that more than 80% of the planet is comprised of non-nation state self-organizing regions - also known as the [[Intercity Planetary]] - yet very little formalized culture exists to recognize this existing condition with which to more accurately organize it. 
  
  The core historical genesis of the [[The Tragedy of the Middles]] is the 15th Century, in which the network of [[Intercity Planetary]] intellectuals which spanned Africa-Asia, Asia-Amerindia, and Proto-Indo-Europe - had compiled a system of [[inference]]s published in [[Thomas More's]] [[Utopia]] , amongst many other texts, which produced the movement of [[Humanism]], founding much of the cultural and legal innovations of that time with varying degrees of ethical implementation.  
  
  These texts included a consensus support for universal basic income, the valuation of goods based primarily on their use value, a knowledge-first economy driven by skilled generalism promoted through the propagation of mediation technologies, and also peaceable global trade relations.
  
  Simultaneously, in the 15th Century, the accounting techniques comprising capitalism were invented by the Hanseatic League of Germany, and they were variated by a few entrepreneurs into the initial colonial ventures into the Americas which illegally extracted precious metals, lands, technologies and cultures, which form the distribution of planetary law and property today.
  
  These distributions are in active litigation by multiple populations across the world and have progressed to such a degree that a solid legal foundation has formed to articulate retroactive claims and justify expropriative measures, both legal and extralegal.
- 7 Core [[inference]]s of [[The Tragedy of the Middles]] as articulated by the [[Open Source Universal Basic Intelligence Communities]].
	- 1. There is no planetary legal framework. The construction of one at current planetary capacity would take possibly 100 years. A significant breakthrough was achieved recently.
		- Workaround: Indigenous / military / teen / ai
	- 2. There is no market integrating the newest sciences and data to produce accurate prices and sustainable logistics. The acculturation of the skills and tools necessary at current planetary capacity would take possibly 100 years.  A significant breakthrough was achieved recently.
		- NFT / Post-fragiletopia / Until / Post-fragile 9
	- 3. There is no climate change synthesis research center. The acculturation of the skills and tools necessary at current planetary capacity would take possibly 100 years. A significant breakthrough was achieved recently.

	- 4. There is a massive over-specialization and incapacitation in the Humanities which does not synthesize the analytic tradition, mathematical and technological tools and aesthetic and poetic sensiblities and thus cripples any possible coherent Left resistance without a 40 year cultural shift. A significant breakthrough was achieved recently, particularly by Manuel De Landa's Assemblage Theory.
		- Post-fragile Intelligence: / Accuracy / [[inference]] / Gravity / Negentropy (Martial Arts)
	- 5. The sciences also over-specialized and have incentives integrated into social network biases. Thus synthesis of a planetary ontology would take possibly 100 years. A significant breakthrough was achieved recently.
		- Church of Superpositional State : Least Stupid /  Saintnet / Gen N / Heartbets
	- 6. There is a lack of skilled laborers who can integrate and synthesize multiple functions accurately. This is also due to the acculturation of inacurate markets which incentivize and acculturate specialization, corruption and individualist entrepreneurialism. A significant breakthrough was achieved recently.
		- Healightenment : Learn / Get paid / Commission / Teach
	- 7. There is no consensus on an optimal split of private and public social floors, ceilings and provisions and the division of labor between humans and non-humans.  This can be traced back to a lack of public knowledge management systems, which produce [[Recurrent Events]], or simple surface conflicts of systemic disorganization and an amnesiac culture , rather than [[Real Current Events]] which are changes in the core systems which produce novel complexifications as a byproduct that produce recursive cultural feedback systems. A significant breakthrough was achieved recently.
