- **Capitalism is an in[[accurate]] market dependent on the suppression of information to perpetuate **unsustainable inequities. An [[accurate]] market would require a social floor composed of both private and public organizations producing mixed implementations of universal basic income, health care, arts-based education, infrastructure, maximum 20 hour work-weeks. Endpoints can be measured at a regional scale as follows: Carbon neutrality, 88% equality as calculated via the Gini Coefficient and a contribution to a planetary-scale paradigm shift every 7 years. Only [[3.5%]] of a population is required to make a political change, which can be rapidly augmented with automation, algorithms and new scientific findings.
