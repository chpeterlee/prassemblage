- 1. Neganthropomorphosis is the description of a universal probabilistic law and process which selects more complex net negentropic systems states over time in all physical and informational systems of the universe; it also posits that most existing informational and physical systems of the universe can be adequately described as assemblages of quantum photons or polaritons.
- 2. This single process can include infinite sub-tasks, variations and assemblages of [[inference]]s, including indefinite ontological entities or multi-ontological entities.
- 3. Integral to this process is a constant re-assemblage of material, information, technologies and subjectivities; there is no singular paradigm that will be applicable across all problem spaces.
- 4. Neganthropomorphosis claims that the adjacent possibilities of any given problem space, from a cell to a heart to a screwdriver or a quantum computer, expand at a minum rate of light speed squared; simultaneously neganthropomorphosis claims that the majority of physical systems are constrained by inherited limits on energy and informational rates of change according to any given arbitrarily frozen time-slice.
- 5. Given these upper and lower bounds, neganthropomorphosis then suggests differing solutions for differingly scaled and frequetialized problem spaces and possibility spaces; problem and possibility spaces can be further sub-divided into verifiable and unverifiable claims, using both empirical and post-empirical sciences through post-normal scientific protocols, including [[SRP]], or the Statistical Review Protocol.
