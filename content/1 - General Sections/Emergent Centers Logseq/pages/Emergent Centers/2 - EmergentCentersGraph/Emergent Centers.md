- # 1. About
	- The [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]] is composed of distributed human-machine teams of academics, activists, organizers, publics, both human and non-human coordinating public knowledge production towards maximum inclusive scalability for the actual majority of the planet.
	- Inferences within this public knowledge system are graded in a spectrum:
		- Unverified
		- Verified
		- Research-grade peer reviewed
		- Statistically reviewed and proofed.
	- [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]] hosts various publications, from small press publications to peer-reviewed journals.  It is based on an open-source cloud and AI-based [[inference]] and claims knowledge management system using a custom blockchain protocol.

- # 2. Principles
	- [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]] operates off of philostatistical proofs that both physical and informational systems are composed of [[inference]]s which can be verified according to the statistical mechanics of quantum photons, matter and [[potential energy systems]] in relation to the dynamics of Earth's gravitational systems.
	- The language and mediation methods deployed by the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]] is based on assumptions that 70% of modern populations are functioning with high-school level literacies, 29.9% of the population comprising professional specialists have high-school level literacies and a few related specialized skills and roughly .1% or less of the population have polymath grade literacies and skills.

- # 3. Method
	- There are 3 major verification processes of the [[SRP]] used to triangulate verification of strong [[inference]]s:
		- Physical evidence.
		- Simulations of philostatistical models.
		- AI-aided search and strong [[inference]] of existing datasets.
	- Unless a particular page is marked as having undergone peer review and follows publishing standards, it is not considered to be of peer-reviewed quality.
