- The [[Ethical Futures Institute]] is a distributed network of polymaths that construct, verify and certify protocols according to the [[Statistical Review Protocol]], which simply just measures the [[net negentropy]] or net [[entropy]] of any given model, behavior, system or inference.

	- The Ethical Futures Institute is an assemblage of individuals and non-human intelligences utilizing quantum computational cameras to provide guidance on specific research inquiries.
	- The Ethical Futures Institute is a quantum-aware organization which utilizes polymath-quality consulting, non-linear simulators and quantum-balanced datasets to aggregate [[Inclusively Scaleable]] processes, deliverables and goals. Every 3 months, the [[Ethical Futures Institute]] and the [[Planetary Research Assemblage]] update the [[Intercity Planetary]] quantum-aware network and transactional guide to incorporate the most inclusively scaleable practice s.
	- Currently, the [[Ethical Futures Institute]] is coordinating to produce polymath and simulator verifiable strategies to prevent irreversible ecological catastrophe in 10 years and prevent the most children from dying of preventable poverty per day, which is occurring at the current rate of 12,000 per day.
