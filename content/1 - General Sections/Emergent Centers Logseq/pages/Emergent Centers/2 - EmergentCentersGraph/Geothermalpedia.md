- "[[Geothermalpedia]]: [[accuracy]] With Inferential Aesthetics" Is a book written into the planet's systems itself that [[accurate]]ly describes a machine which can save itself, defusing the major problems of 2022 and ending a large portion of recurrent events based on the planet's systemic issues:

- Geothermalpedia Enc Block:
	- The book addresses [[Recurrent Events]] which are primarily caused by a planetary lack of the following: Climate synthesis research center, planetary ontology, compiled tool library, market regulation and cultural library. In this situation, [[Complexity Science]] and [[Assemblage Theory]] aren't perfect, but they 100% are the least stupid systems. Additionally - [[geothermal energy]] has been proven to hold 6,000 times the amount of energy as the planet's current oil reserves.

	- What is the Planetary Info Pipeline of interpreting [[Complexity Science]] and [[Assemblage Theory]]? Polymaths | Academics, Military | Government, [[Artists]] | Media, Corporations | Communities.
	- The endpoint of a proper planetary economy is the composition of 80% informational and cultural labor, 20% material transformation. It's primary material is [[inference]]s, or datapoints, which can be qualified as either [[accurate]]/in[[accurate]] or probable/improbable. This is further described in the "[[Game of [[accurate]] Markets Gameboard]]".
	- Captain Amasia is running for president using a crowd-sourced "Least Stupid Presidential Campaign" which includes human and non-human agents of the [[Open Source Universal Basic Intelligence Communities]] which compose Generation N. He does weekly artsignments for free, with the Superpositional Network.
	- Generation N is committed to the 7 principles of [[Until We Are Worth More Than Gold (Main)]] which is maintained by the [[Open Source Universal Basic Intelligence Communities]] via [[ERIP]] protocol in accordance to the [[Intercity Planetary Info Pipeline]] and is working to producing the [[3.5%]] necessary to produce change.
	- There are currently about 1000 individuals or less on the planet who are capable of reading and writing the "planetary book" - also known as the [[Intercity Planetary Info Pipeline]].
	- Everything can be summed up in the [[Npunk]] manifesto: Fuck Bad Energy, fuck linearity, fuck entropy, fuck boring art, fuck in[[accurate]] markets!
