	- So I think we have a 4 dimensional ontology:
	- 1. Conceptual [[inference]] - can be traced to the vary output of the syllogism.
	- 2. Perceptual [[inference]] - we can talk about eyes and brain as a system of triangulation of [[inference]]s, at minimum
	- 3. Affective [[inference]] - we can talk about animals and physical systems as inferential tinkering through fitness landscapes - also technologies and markets and culture
	- 4. We can talk about a cosmology based on emergent [[inference]]s - using the paper from above + autodidactic universe
	- It's pretty dope we can just intersect into any existing discourse haha
	- I also think we can just call the PRA an Earth Subsystems Science research group
	- 5. And then the 5th part is the history of Strong [[inference]]
	- 6. What's amazing to note is that with negentropy and vacuum Decay- quantum mechanics gains a trajectory. I think really that's what was missing in the theory - and created the wave function collapse dilemma. Superposition without negentropy simply just propagates possibilities, it doesn't have a selector function. So with those 2 basic phenomena, negentropy over time and negation of vacuum Decay, quantum mechanics can then infer a selection function, which then allows for emergence over time - to the classical level
	- There's also some cool recent stuff on quanta on the ability to infer information backwards in time in quantum systems - and also confirms our stance that probability is atemporal, or an immanent adjacent possible which has a nice echo in the cooler propositions in Penrose's conformal theory.
	- 7. I think for me, I'd place more bets on Kaufmanns [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Narrative/Poised Realm]], which allows for reversibility between the two. I also like De Landaâ€™s position on the Cosmic Assemblage, which is also a reversible transformer. In other words, I think we are on the right track! Good to have a higher resolution view of the current [[inference]]scape though :)
