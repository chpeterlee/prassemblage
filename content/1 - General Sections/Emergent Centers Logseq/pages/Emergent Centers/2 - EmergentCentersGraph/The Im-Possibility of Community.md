- In relation to GameB
  
  **Below is Peter's Take - feel free to critique!** --------------------------------------------
- 1. A human body is an interpreter of wider physical reality first, constructed socialities second.
  2. Problems of interpretation arise every second. The skill required to continuously interpret physical reality and the incorrectly requires constant autodidacticism.
- 3. Nomadic tribes used to raise fully autonomous bodies by age 11.
- 4. The vast majority of the modern population (estimated around 3 billion) objectively cannot function autonomously when given modern education curriculums due to various pre-conditions not being met (adequate wealth distribution, health care, trans-cultural translations or tools.)
- 5. The skills to navigate autonomously, pro-socially and creatively can be learned - but they take time to transfer from one body to another. However, this time can be cut down with a properly organized curriculum.
- 6. The 4 legs of this curriculum are: logic, math, making and mediation. An individual body doesn't need to be a master of any particular leg, they just need the core fundamentals of each one. A properly constructed curriculum could transfer a competent level of the fundamentals within 7 hours. The perfect curriculum would be a child's game learnable in 7 minutes.
- 7. This is the best case for Universal Basic Income, Health Care, Education and Meshworks. It gives time and space for people to develop the core literacies necessary for planetary navigation.
- 0. The "Problem" of interpreting reality is immanent from body to body, second to second, and must be embraced through play, creativity and compassion. It will never be solved only surfed! 
  
  **Daniel(aka rruido)'s take**
- Dealing with moderation:
	- This is not a big problem in physical/spatially-limited communities
		- Geographical boundaries
		- Limited resources, cooperation is needed to optimize their use
		- Acceptable behaviours are organically agreed upon by the social contract and are constrained by external natural forces
		- The objective of the community is simply its survival (the survival of its members)
		- However there can still be exceptions (crime (non acceptable behaviour)) that require moderation (law)
	- In online communities those conditions do not apply
		- No limit on space/resources, the limits are psychological (attention, understanding)
		- acceptable behaviours depend solely on the culture of the community (no external forces)
		- possibiliy of unstable identities / anonnymity make the social contract fail
		- the community is not required for the survival of its members, so...
		- **What is its objective/intention??**
		- A clear objective is required in order to know what is acceptable / how to moderate
			- Or maybe not? Let the community govern itself organically
				- Danger of implicit biases (racism) taking control, creation of filter bubbles
- Miscommunication / misunderstandings
	- People meet online and they do not agree on something
		- Most probably they do not properly understand each other since they come from different cultures
		- Rationalist solution:
			- Define propositions, argue about [[inference]]s, find whether there is disagreement in core assumptions, experiment/gather data to find out who is right
		- Playful solution:
			- Assume good faith (we are all humans)
			- Misunderstandings are happy accidents
			- Create a joke / meme out of it
			- Both parties laugh and understand each other better
