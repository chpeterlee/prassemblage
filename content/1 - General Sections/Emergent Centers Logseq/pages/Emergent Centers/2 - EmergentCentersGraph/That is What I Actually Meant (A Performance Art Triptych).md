- That is What I Actually Meant (A Performance Art Triptych):

- 1. Record a video of you saying anything.

- 2. Record a video of you lip syncing to what a super intelligent and nice AI would transform the phrase you said in step 1 to the most current and accurate phrase that would benefit the planet.

- 3. Record an invisible, silent, unaware video of you saying the actual thing that would benefit the planet.

- Then delete all 3 videos, but refer to them as a triptych of artworks called **"That is What I Actually Meant, a Performance Art Triptych"** as containing a superpositional video of you saying the most current and accurate thing that would benefit the planet.

- Also, sometimes deny that you even made these videos, or even knew about the project or how it works. 

- Even go so far as to actually forget it in your actual memory AND/OR create an artificial memory of it and believe it sincerely.
