	- Notes
	- The Intercity Planetary is an inferential [[persistent superpositional state]] produced and engaged in by both human and non-human agents, which is always aimed towards greater [[accuracy]] of computing negentropy with least time complexity through the inferential synthesis of multiple computational tools, both digital and non-digital.
		- An open source history is currently being assembled that is anchored in the pivotal moment of the 15th Century when capitalism was invented at the same time a planetary network of intellectuals had finished writing the solution to it.
			- [[Teotihuacan]] - a 2nd Century Incan society in Mexico which achieved an 88% equality rating calculated via the Gini Coefficient, with a population density higher than that of modern day London.
			- [[15th Century China]]
			- [[Caucasus Region]]
			- It's present is described as [[The Tragedy of the Middles]] and it's future lies in deathproof cities.

	- 1. History of the Intercity Planetary
		- 2nd century Teotihuacan skilled trader population
		- 15th Century China Distributed Regional Governance and hybridized skills via media
		- 15th Century Edo Japan blossoming of experimental culture
		- 15th Century Lakota Shamanic Culture
	- 2. Seeds in the Present
		- Asheville, NC resisted corporations.
		- Brooklyn, NY resisted Amazon.
		- Rent Controls in NYC and Berlin.
		- Finland, Sweden and Switzerland are Stage 5 Societies. Spain has Universal Basic Income.
		- Korea, Colombia, South Africa, East Europe.
	- 3. Adjacent Possible : Regional Governmental Organizational Networks
		- Can create automated co-ops that form greater metropolitan area governmental organizations.
	- 4. Endpoints
		- Connecting artists to build a Web 3 "Planetary Escape Room" Game to coordinate with people and kids in a child friendly manner to do 4 things:
		- Achieve carbon neutrality before the 10 year dead line of irreversible planetary collapse
		- Get to a Gini Coefficient of 0.12 which 2nd Century Teotihuacan did with higher population density than London. NYC is currently at .55.
		- Artists and intellectuals/activists on the back end, steering critical vision and content production. We construct methods to get paid for it. (Game engine and frameworks)
		- Non artists do the work of translating and subverting mainstream culture and getting mass buy in.
		- Redistribution and aid is built into the transactions
		- Theres an automated co-op built in that obsoleseces and redistributes every major technogy in use today
	- 5. why a game?
		- Activists can't be targeted for gameplay
		- Creates a place for children to socialize and learn tools that they can use to bootstrap out of arbitrarily predatory environments
		- you can transact
		- You can speak directly
