- # 1. Introduction
- The [[Postworketariat]] is a collective subjectivity built on the assumption that 70%+ of modern societies function on an extralegal nomadic small tribe form of organization. As such it has 3 principle protocols of interaction:
- 1. Individuals are free to engage in maximal self-entropy, self-fragilization, self-destruction; they are also free not to engage in any social norms, systems of exchange or cosmopolitics unless they choose to do so.
	- As such, individuals of the [[Postworketariat]] are already existing members of a [[post-work]] society; albeit not one which is structured and tuned for most positive outcomes for the most individuals. Hence there are many instances of preventable death, exploitation and entropy as well as novel forms of living, mutualism, intellectualism and invention. These problems have been related to both the [[lumpenproletariat]] and the [[precariat]].
	- Often, members of the [[Postworketariat]] display either deskilling, undereducation or trauma.
- 2. They cannot execute harmful, manipulative or exploitative actions upon others; they also retain the right for proportional peacemaking. If harmed, manipulated or exploited, they have access to a spectrum of proportionally violent, non-lethal and non-violent responses.
	- This is analogous to some police forces' concepts of a "spectrum of violence".
- 3. Each individual of the [[Postworketariat]] lives and acts from an individually parameterized ontology that then interacts with other individual-scale members. Most ontologies are not designed to scale beyond 5 to 20 members; as such it is unnecessary to platform them as a gesture towards a collectivity that does not exist.
	- All propositions from the [[Postworketariat]] should be understood as only functioning at and aspiring to the scale of 5 to 20 members.

- 2. Contextualization of Construction
- The Postworketariat and the Lumpenproletariat are two different perspectives that have been used to describe the social class that exists outside the traditional labor market.
- The Lumpenproletariat is a term that was coined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the mid-19th century. They used it to describe a social class of individuals who are not productive and who do not have any significant role in the means of production. The Lumpenproletariat was viewed negatively as a social class that lacked any revolutionary potential and was seen as a threat to the working class due to its susceptibility to criminal activity and political manipulation.
- The Postworketariat, on the other hand, is a more contemporary perspective that describes a social class that operates outside the traditional labor market. The Postworketariat is not seen as a threat to the working class, but rather as a potential source of creativity and innovation. This perspective recognizes the autonomy of individuals and their ability to engage in non-traditional forms of work, such as freelance or gig work.
- In terms of the positive view of the Lumpenproletariat, both perspectives share a recognition of the potential for creative and innovative activity outside of the traditional labor market. However, the Lumpenproletariat is viewed negatively due to its association with criminal activity and political manipulation.
- In terms of the negative view of the Lumpenproletariat, the Postworketariat differs significantly. While the Lumpenproletariat is seen as a threat to the working class, the Postworketariat is viewed as an alternative to traditional forms of work and a potential source of creativity and innovation.
- Overall, the Postworketariat represents a more contemporary perspective that recognizes the changing nature of work and the potential for creative and innovative activity outside of traditional forms of employment. It differs significantly from the Lumpenproletariat, which was viewed negatively due to its association with criminal activity and political manipulation.
- The mobilization of the Lumpenproletariat has been seen in various political movements and communities throughout history, including the support base of former President Donald Trump, the Yippie movement of the 1970s, artistic communities focused on identity politics and therapeutic practice s, and professionally employed individuals and leaders who display behaviors of neurochemical imbalance and entropic output.
- The support base of Donald Trump has been seen by some as a mobilization of the Lumpenproletariat. This group is made up of individuals who feel left behind by the changing economy and who are disillusioned with traditional political parties. They are often associated with white working-class communities and have been characterized as being prone to conspiracy theories and right-wing extremism. However, this perspective has been criticized by others who argue that it is overly simplistic and ignores the diversity of opinions and motivations among Trump supporters.
- The Yippie movement of the 1970s was a political and cultural movement that mobilized the Lumpenproletariat through countercultural practice s and anti-establishment rhetoric. The movement was characterized by a rejection of traditional values and institutions and a focus on individual freedom and creativity. It was often associated with drug use, free love, and anti-war protests.
- Artistic communities focused on identity politics and therapeutic practice s can also be seen as a mobilization of the Lumpenproletariat. These communities are often made up of individuals who feel marginalized by mainstream society and who use art as a means of expressing their identity and exploring their emotions. They often reject traditional standards of beauty and form and are characterized by a focus on self-expression and individuality.
- Finally, professionally employed individuals and leaders who display behaviors of neurochemical imbalance and entropic output can also be seen as a mobilization of the Lumpenproletariat. These individuals are often characterized by a lack of discipline and focus, a disregard for social norms and conventions, and a tendency towards impulsivity and risk-taking behavior. They are often associated with high-stress jobs and a culture of overwork and burnout.
- Overall, the mobilization of the Lumpenproletariat can be seen in a variety of political and cultural movements and communities. These groups often reject traditional values and institutions and prioritize individual freedom and creativity. However, they are also associated with a lack of discipline and a disregard for social norms, which can lead to negative consequences for both the individuals involved and the broader society.

- 3. Contextualization of Application
- The [[Postworketariat]] is a concept utilized in the [[Postworkverse Church]] and various other projects.
- Re-orienting the Lumpenproletariat towards a post-work trajectory can have several positive outcomes. By embracing a post-work philosophy, nomadic small groups can create social interactions that are free from expectations of labor, enabling individuals to engage in activities and pursuits that are fulfilling and meaningful to them. This can help to reduce the fragility of organizations, as individuals who are engaged in activities that align with their interests and values are more likely to be motivated and committed to the group.
- Furthermore, by properly tasking individuals with neurochemical imbalances, such as those who exhibit behaviors of impulsivity and risk-taking, groups can harness their unique strengths and abilities towards the collective goal of the organization. This can lead to a more diverse and robust group, as individuals with different strengths and weaknesses are able to contribute in meaningful ways.
- In addition, re-orienting the Lumpenproletariat towards a post-work trajectory can serve as an irrefutable ethical argument for connecting institutions and infrastructure towards a larger goal of post-work regionalism. By embracing a post-work philosophy, individuals and groups can challenge the dominant narrative of work as the central organizing principle of society. Instead, they can advocate for a more humane and sustainable future, where individuals are free to pursue their passions and interests, and where the social and economic systems are designed to support these pursuits.
- In summary, re-orienting the Lumpenproletariat towards a post-work trajectory can have several positive outcomes, including creating social interactions free from expectations of labor, reducing the fragility of organizations, harnessing the unique strengths of individuals with neurochemical imbalances, and serving as an ethical argument for connecting institutions and infrastructure towards a larger goal of post-work regionalism.

- 4. Inferrable Worldview
- The worldview inferred by the Postworketariat aligns with several themes from various religions and human social paradigms, as well as with the general physionomic design of the human body and brain.
- From a Christian perspective, the Postworketariat's emphasis on individual autonomy and the rejection of systems of exchange or cosmopolitics can be seen as an echo of the Protestant work ethic, which emphasizes the value of individual effort and hard work. However, the Postworketariat differs in its rejection of work as a central organizing principle of society and instead embraces a post-work philosophy, which encourages individuals to pursue their passions and interests, regardless of their economic value.
- Similarly, from a Buddhist perspective, the Postworketariat's emphasis on individual autonomy and the rejection of social norms can be seen as a reflection of the Buddhist concept of non-attachment, which encourages individuals to let go of their attachments and desires and to find inner peace and happiness. The Postworketariat's rejection of systems of exchange or cosmopolitics can also be seen as an echo of the Buddhist concept of non-self, which emphasizes the idea that the self is an illusion and that all phenomena are interconnected and interdependent.
- The majority human social paradigm of nomadic self-organization, which is central to the Postworketariat worldview, can be seen as a reflection of the human need for autonomy and self-determination. This paradigm emphasizes the importance of individual choice and self-expression, as well as the value of social connections and community.
- Furthermore, the aspirations of arts-based nomadic self-organization, which the Postworketariat embraces, align with the human need for creativity and self-expression. This paradigm emphasizes the value of the arts as a means of exploring the human experience and expressing one's unique perspective and identity.
- Finally, the general physionomic design of both the human body and brain supports the Postworketariat's emphasis on individual autonomy and self-expression. The human body and brain are designed to be adaptable and flexible, allowing individuals to respond to changing environments and to express their unique perspectives and experiences.
- In summary, the worldview inferred by the Postworketariat aligns with several themes from Christianity, Buddhism, the majority human social paradigm of nomadic self-organization, aspirations of arts-based nomadic self-organization, and the general physionomic design of both the human body and brain. These themes emphasize the importance of individual autonomy, self-expression, and community, and encourage individuals to explore their unique perspectives and experiences.
