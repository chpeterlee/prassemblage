- In [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), an **ordinal number**, or **ordinal**, is a generalization of [ordinal numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_numeral) (first, second, __n__th, etc.) aimed to extend [enumeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration) to [infinite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set).1(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number#cite_note-1)
- An enumeration process of a finite collection consists of labeling successively each element with the least [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) that has not been previously used. For extending the process to an [infinite set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set), one can define ordinal numbers as [linearly ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_ordered) labels that contain the natural numbers and have the property that every set of ordinals has a least element (this is needed for giving a meaning to "the least unused element").2(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number#cite_note-2)
- A linear order such that every subset has a least element is called a [well-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order). The [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice) implies that every set can be well-ordered, and given two well-ordered sets, one is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic) to an [initial segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_segment) of the other. So, ordinal numbers exist, and are essentially unique.
- Ordinal numbers are distinct from [cardinal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number), which measure the size of sets. Although the distinction between ordinals and cardinals is not always apparent on finite sets (one can go from one to the other just by counting labels), they are very different in the infinite case, where different infinite ordinals can correspond to sets having the same cardinal. Like other kinds of numbers, ordinals can be [added, multiplied, and exponentiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_arithmetic), although none of these operations are commutative.
- Ordinals were introduced by [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) in 18833(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number#cite_note-3) in order to accommodate infinite sequences and classify [derived sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_set_%28mathematics%29), which he had previously introduced in 1872—while studying the uniqueness of [trigonometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_series).4(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number#cite_note-4)
