- curious what your thoughts are on death. ive been thinking about the connection between improvisation and (social) death. and how cultures that have experienced the most social death are often the ones with the deepest improvisational practice s. when i play with others and listen to others, i have to give up my ego - let it die - to be able to join the flow of the process, the feel of the other bodies in the space. and how this kind of death is also a release out of the shackles of individuated life, thus becoming a huge source of communal strength, spiritual sustenance, you name it.

thinking of radical black culture here

but also transgender and queer life

my batteries gonna die but hit me with some thoughts, no rush¬†üê•

- Np. Well, first I think those are pretty amazing thoughts already hahah. I hope I can add something to it - let me try

- So primarily I think death is just accurately defined as a transformative process rather than a "negative loss"; I take a more general look at it as some type of system undergoing a radical transition and then shifting how it affects itself and other things - like ice melting to water or water to gas.

- I think this fits with the connection you are drawing with society and improvisation - say we let certain ways of being or becoming "die" or transform, it frees up other modes and connections

- It also totally makes sense that cultures who have experienced more of these transitions have developed a wider vocabulary and toolset for dealing and flowing the transitions themselves - this is why I always also like DIY culture myself

- This more flexible and expanded set of tools to handle and direct and create transitions also supports the idea that it's a source of strength and spiritual sustenance. Yes 100% . So it even gets to a super boring part where you can actually mathematically simulate and project and proof that certain groups of humans with certain collective cultural toolkits and vocabularies could self organize better than others under the same catastrophic conditions - almost like a video game hahah. To make it simpler, it's like we can just bet on certain groups/regions etc, almost like existential sports. But to keep it from going into fascist territory, I'd say that ultimately, no single culture can do everything perfectly, and really the ultimate culture would be the groups that would be able to connect with the imperfections of all groups, which circles right back around to supporting your point :P
