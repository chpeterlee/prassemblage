- 1. Abstract
- The [[Semiotechne Symphonies]] is named after [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/1 - Knowledge/Individuals/Chongha Peter Lee]]'s concept of [[Semiotechne]]. It is an audio/visual body of work meant to synthesize problems and solutions that were emerging in 2015. It focuses on 3 principles:
	- Affective problems can be resolved through the perspective of quantum chemistry.
	- Conceptual problems can be resolved through a transmedia approach.
	- Perceptual problems can be resolved through assemblages of functions.
- List of works in the Ouevre:

	- Notes
		- When one reaches light speed, you simply see the cosmic background radiation blotting everything out as an intense light - great image of Guattari's concept, and also, the best possible simulation to create as a projection, or VR simulation of this inaudible sound.
