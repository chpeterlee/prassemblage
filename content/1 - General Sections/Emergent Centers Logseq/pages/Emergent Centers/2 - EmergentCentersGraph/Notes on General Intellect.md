- **Science** is simply statistical modelling and corroboration, based on Richard Feynman, Karl Popper, Schrodinger.
	 - Roger Penrose's arguments against quantum mechanics and for general relativity can be re-framed simply as two value logic vs. many-valued logic - which is much more in use in current statistical analyses.

	 - The fields of science are aptly visualized as different tribes with different epistemic cultures - processes of statistical modelling. It takes time to produce common languages to exchange information. Thus, the labor of changing scientific fields can be projected.

	 - AI can do alot to rapidly accelerate the exchange and consensus building.

- **Philosophy**:
	 - Many philosophical propositions can be resolved simply by not using the qualifier "All" and using the claim of "more likely" or "less likely".  It is easier to statistically test philosophical propositions when defined in time and with a spatial scale. 

	 - AI can rapidly proof the statistical likelihood of any possible proposition when qualified mildly in time and space.

	 - Also - it is easy to accelerate bridges across scientific fields and reinforce obvious philosophical universals by simply articulating them negatively.

	 - The implementation of activist actions can be greatly increased in likelihood through logistical mapping and automation by ethical hackers.

- **Art**:
	 - Art can easily be defined by the following argument:

	 - 1. What art could not possibly be - is the destruction of the universe; because this would negate the very conditions of existence of art.

	 - 2. Art exists within the universe - and must obey it's more general statistical laws over time.

	 - 3. Art boils down to a light signal transmitted into a viewer. 

	 - 4. A "viewer", like all else in the universe, is simply a weighted statistical model. Hence, an "artificial viewer" can be constructed which has specified statistical preferences. A more familiar analogue is to simply look at how an "artificial eye" can be constructed in the form of a mechanical lens which has specific statistical biases.

	 - 5. If the constraints of a statistical model are articulated enough, it doesn't even need to be physically built - it can be simulated, either through an electronic computational device or even something as simple as a role-playing game with children.

- **Commerce**
	 - 1. All commerce can be aligned with the greater statistical principles of the universe over time. Many ideological policy positions, such as universal basic income, health care, or racism even - can be objectively resolved upon statistical grounds.

	 - 2. This can be rendered as an algorithm, a statistical model that interfaces with other existing systems.

	 - 3. Specific qualifiers can be set for geographic locale, spatial scale and timescale. 
		 - Carbon neutrality

		 - Regional equality of 88%

		 - Participation in the production of planetary intellectual paradigm shifts.

	 - 4. All economic transactions are simply components within a larger statistical model; if articulated, they can be simulated.

	 - 5. More complex models require more complex simulation systems. For the most part, the human mind without a technical aid is inadequate for complex systems larger than 100 components.

- **Culture**
	 - 1. All labor should always be divided between whether a machine or a human should execute it. 

	 - 2. Humans are horrible at computation and can juggle maybe 2 to 3 statistical components in a conversation. Machines can do much better. However, machines are horrible at multi-lateral physical computation and poetry. 

	 - 3. There is a line of popular culture which infuses novel intellectual thought experiments into pop forms - this is really the most interesting ground of culture.

	 - 4. Complex statistical play is already embedded in games and any system dealing with physical mechanics - including toys.

	 - 5. Much of psychosocial issues can be resolved by simply producing more open statistical modelling environments. One of the interesting uses of art is the surrealist vein which encourages the creative play of constraints.
