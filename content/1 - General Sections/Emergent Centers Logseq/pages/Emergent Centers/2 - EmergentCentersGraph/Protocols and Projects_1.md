		- 7. Each inference can be statistically reviewed, if desired.
		- 8. But we can produce and trade "Critical Coin" on the Postwork Exchange in the form of these beautiful purple squares ![ðŸŸª]
		- 9. Postworkcraft is a a "Postwork-positive" Game :
		- Postwork-Positivity ðŸŸª
		- Postwork-positivity is a personal, subjective stance which endorses the statistically accurate position that a postwork society is the most inclusively scalable trajectory for societies today, based on 5th Generation Revolutionary theory which takes a statistically accurate appraisal of the systemic fragility of Left-leaning organizations and the asymmetry of technological capacity being concentrated into a few individual polymaths. ![ðŸŸª]
		- [[Postwork-Positive]] Culture
		- 10. Postworkcraft also has an ongoing minigame of trying or not trying to imagine unimaginable solutions that already exist; so players acknowledge that there are solutions that exist that they can't imagine, like how the sun already solved the problem of nuclear fusion, but humans have yet to articulate it, despite living in its constant presence.
		  
		  No player is required to inform all the other players of all the details of solutions; just like how the sun doesn't tell us how it works.
		  
		  The image of all the unimaginable solutions that already exist - the sun! ![ðŸŒž]
		- Per contribution to solutions, players get rewards. There is also a lottery.
