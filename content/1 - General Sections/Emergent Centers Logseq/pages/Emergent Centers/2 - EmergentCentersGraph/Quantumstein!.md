- "Quantumstein!", a portmanteau of "quantum" and Frankstein, uses developing lenses of speculative archaeology to propose both monstrous and messianic syntheses of material, information, history and culture. The exhibition is framed as a speculative sandbox to offer a space outside of isolationist formalism and repetitive socio-political echo chambers.

- Using empirically proven aspects of quantum mechanics as a framework to both ground and expand the metaphor and potentiality of Frankstein's collaged body and psyche, participating artists weld multiple paradigms of both sciences and imagination to produce speculative organs and limbs, which may or may not hold solutions to today's crises, in part or in whole. 

- Throughout the exhibition, accuracy and intuition are both carefully architected and haphazardly improvised like circulatory systems or a garden; quantum computation fuses with alchemy, statistics trades cells with Christianity, Romanticism intertwines with playfulness.

- In the face of today's high stakes crises and low level imagination, "Quantumstein!" boldly responds - "What If?!"
