- "Peace Games in the Age of Playtheon", is an artwork, book, film and reality game written by [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/1 - Knowledge/Individuals/Chongha Peter Lee]] , member of the [[Trees Writing Books]] Collective, assemblaging functions from [[Manuel De Landa]]'s [[War in the Age of Intelligent Machines]] and [[Hito Steyerl]]'s [[How Not To Be Seen: Not Another Fucking Didactic Movie]]. This work centers around 3 philostatistical wagers:
	- 1. AI does/does not have an optomal point of balanced use at 3 scales: individual body, regional and planetary.  (Peter wagers yes it does).
	  
	  2. Given proper constraints, AI does/does not have a positive impact on the domains of both non-vocational knowledge production and socioeconomic exchange. (Peter wagers yes it does).
	  
	  3. The most promising process of constructing proper constraints for AI does/does not require the synthesis of technical, philosophical, artistic and cultural literacies, which are faster to synthesize in a single body. (Peter wagers yes it does).
	- The artwork is approached through three lenses; [[Speculative Archaeology]], [[Perspectival Fiction]], and [[PopSpecPunk]] art.
	- In addition, it is an artwork in itself, and as such, autopoetically deploys the functions it is defining, as it is defining it.
