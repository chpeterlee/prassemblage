- 1. Ontologization
- A notion of sculpture based on Timothy Morton's concept of the [[Hyperobject]], which is an [[Assemblage]] object comprised of inferential links across time, space and other materials.
- The [[Hyperobject]] has similar connotations as [[hypertext]] and [[hyperlinks]], the foundation of the [[bilinking]] system which this graph database uses.

- # 2. Applications
- The concept of the [[Hypersculpture]] can recontextualize both physical and informational forms:
	- [[Sol Lewitt]]'s instructional drawings, [[Yoko Ono]]'s poems, [[Fluxus]] based conceptual work, along with media and performance-based works from the late 90's and early 2000's such as [[Yes Men]] and [[Floating Lab Collective]] amongst others.
	- [[Hypersculpture]] can be used to also materially ground long-standing conceptual art practice s such as [[Duchamp]]'s appropriative methods, along with various conceptual photographic and conceptual video art practice s - and even conceptual painting and drawing practice s such as [[De Kooning]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Cy Twombly]].
	- Other media, from painting to film to social practice , games and any philostatistical, computational or physical system can be recontextualized as hyperpantings.
	- Ultimately, hypersculpture understands all things as autodidactic neganthropic inferential systems composed of quantum photons.
