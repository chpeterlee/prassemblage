- 3. Any given data point on Earth, aka hypothesis, aka [[inference]] in relation to any other point or system on Earth, can be articulated as accurate or inaccurate within a given conditional state space comprised of greater than 1 entity triangulated against the constraints of Earth's gravity and the law of net negentropy.
- 4. Any given epistemological process can be articulated as a ratio of definition to indefinition with a stated time complexity per problem.  Some processes are faster than others; a properly phrased generalist epistemology will outperform any given specialist epistemology and produce greater net negentropy faster due to its higher rate of entropy extraction, negentropy modelling and modularity allowing for an accurate shifting between per information/time unit.
- 5. Any given actualized function in a properly defined state space can be described in terms of as outputting net negentropy or net entropy and can be subdivided into tasks, transformations, systems and environments and bifurcation points or paradigm shifts.
- 6. Any possible thing can be computed accurately, however it is physically impossible to build a computational device which can compute all things accurately all the time.
- 7. At this time, for most problems on Earth which require human consensus, due to the low distribution of statistical computational tools and understanding of the paradoxes comprising quantum mechanics, it is better to balance the computational load per problem between human and machine teams. This already happens in grade school; a 7 year old with a calculator is a human machine team. Even a human executing a simple 1+1 algorithm is technically a "human-machine" team; it is more important to just properly define a problem and its scope, then choose the right mixture of elements to resolve it, including improvisation and intuition, and verify it!
- 8. Several ramifications come about; if an endpoint is not pre-stated, it is less likely to be reached. However if the method is too tightly constrained, the process is less likely to produce net negentropic emergence. If a perspective is inaccurate to the presented system of [[inference]]s; it will do more harm than good. If a process isn't error-checking and possibility generating via the  dual-sided maneuver of strong inferentialism, it will be net entropic. Less modular processes are more fragile.
