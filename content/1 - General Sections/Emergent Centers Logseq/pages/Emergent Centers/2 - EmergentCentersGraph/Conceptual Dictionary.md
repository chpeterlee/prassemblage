- 0. 2 new universal proofs by science:
	- The universe is made of waves of energy who's differing amounts are represented as [[photons]], both visible and invisible.
	- These [[photons]] obey a universal probabilistic law over an arbitrary timescale called [[negentropy]]. This timescale may be as small as light speed in the case of the negation of [[False vacuum decay]].
- 1. Everyday vocab:
	- May or may not
	- Likely and unlikely
	- Actually inclusively scalable or not?

	- [[Probability]] - a foundational concept which states that all systems have variant outcomes with differing likelihoods.
	- [[Ordinalism]] - a numeral system in which the difference between numbers can be different amounts.
	- [[Adjacent Possible]] - refers to the fact that there are at least 10^100 possibilities growing exponentially per second, for something as small as a single heart.
	- [[Inferentialism]] - a set of 7 [[inference]]s which center around the fact that the universe is composed of photons which obey a universal probabilistic law over an arbitrary time scale.
