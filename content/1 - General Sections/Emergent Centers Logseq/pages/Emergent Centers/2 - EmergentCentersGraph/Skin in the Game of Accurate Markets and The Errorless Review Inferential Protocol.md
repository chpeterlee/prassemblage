- The core accurate market principles in open source production with the [[Open Source Universal Basic Intelligence Communities]]:
	- Capitalism is an inaccurate market dependent on the suppression of information to perpetuate unsustainable inequities.
	- An accurate market would require a social floor composed of both private and public organizations producing mixed implementations of universal basic income, health care, arts-based education, infrastructure, maximum 20 hour work-weeks.
	- Only [[3.5%]] of a population is required to make a political change. Different is more.
	- Political change can be rapidly scaled by synthesizing new artistic, philosophical, scientific, technological and cultural tools; there are currently 50 billion bots existing and recently new mixtures of the sciences and humanities have settled questions over a millennia old which allow for a transparent and equitable planetary market.
	- The design and implementation of an accurate market is worth a minimum of $100 billion which can be owned as a co-op, producing almost infinite “Accurate Collar” jobs which would shift labor activity to consist of producing 80% information and culture, 20% material recombination.
	- In addition, this would produce nations with more robust internal systems, thus both reducing the need to wage war and also bolstering their standing in the "Accurate Market Arms Race".
	- Regional economies would meet measurable endpoints of net zero carbon emissions, 88% equality across the region, and intellectual ecologies which can at minimum produce 1 planetary-scale paradigm shift per 7 years.
	- [[Skin in the Game]] refers to __**Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life**__ (acronymed: SITG) is a 2018 nonfiction book by [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb), a former [options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_%28finance%29) trader with a background in the mathematics of [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics).
