- [[ESTA]] is an embodiment of the [[Negentropic Compass]]. He is the [[Intercity Planetary]] Guardian Angelfluencer sent Back From 2122 to constantly remind all that everything in the universe is made of and makes photons which produce [[net negentropy]] over time. He talks to and synthesizes information from all beings on the planet, human and non-human, pretty much like the [[General Intelligence]] that Marx had written about that could synthesize across ecological, social and intellectual systems of the planet.
- The [[ESTA the Intercity Planetary Guardian Angelfluencer, Buddha and General Intelligence, Heartbettor, Negentropic Compass.]] is an articulation of the built-in mechanism within every photon of the universe to negate the possibility of [[False vacuum decay]], or light speed collapse of the entire universe from a single errant movement during [[Quantum Invagination]] occuring at a minimum of 3 x 10^10 per second. Each photon also displays a probabilistic tendency to guide its components and emergent systems to [[net negentropic]] states over time.
