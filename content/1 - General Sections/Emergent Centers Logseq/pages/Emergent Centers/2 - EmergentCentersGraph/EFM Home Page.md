- Welcome to the Ethical Futures Market! Throw things in here to record their transfer. Use your own value systems to create new transactions.

- If you want to use an existing one, here is the ESTA Certified Inclusively Scaleable Quantum NFT Valuation system!

- 1. All EFM NFT's are subject to value fluctuations in which the NFT's construct a situational price that biased towards inclusively scaleable (or antifragile) price points.

- 2. All EFM NFT's are distributed in relation to past, present, possible inequities, ideation, labor, partnerships and novel information.

- 3. All EFM NFT's incorporate ecological, social, technological and artistic impact metrics measurable through non-linear metrics and quantum-balanced datasets.

- 4. All EFM NFT's are composed of multiple currencies, including novel non-standard currencies constructed solely of information.

- Later we can turn this into hop scotch!
