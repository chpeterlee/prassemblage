	 - Be blue if they want you to be white, be pink if they want you to be black. Shout out and say the truth. What is the truth and for what is this fight in this world?

	 - I feel that many times life is an abstraction and that what we create is another hope not to get lost.

	 - We are the new generation, we shall be prepared to build world peace. And why in the middle of the war we feel hopeless. Because we do not have a strategy of peace. People ask me if I am happy in my life and on the personal level I am sometimes. But when I think about all of us, about collective trauma, about the women who are fighting just to live, then how could I be happy? There is always a challenge and if there is a challenge there is a fight. Despite the progress of the world and the fact that there are billions of people, we still miss equality. Too much history and little knowledge. People made solar energy, made nuclear power, and people reached the moon, however evil still exists. New danger is always coming up.

	 - Justice, Justice, Justice, and you know in many situations there was no justice but you also know that you can not give up. Because to be free to find your position in this world is to fight and to believe that in your fight it is not about losing or winning it is about trying.

	 - -------

	 - We have to build and learn. Today the planet is poised between **crisis and possibility**.

	 - 1. There are 10 years to ecological planetary collapse and 12,000 children dying of preventable poverty per day. 70% by 100 corporations. There is less than .1% of them, there are 6.9 billion of us.

	 - 2. We now have teams of humans and machines that can check the accuracy of any possible statement.¬† We also have the technological capacity to solve any possible properly defined problem.

	 - 3. Who are we? We are all 500 years, or 7 generations from the birth of capitalism and Humanism in the 15th Century which produced some of the greatest achievements and tragedies of the planet‚Äôs history. There is not a single human alive today, black, white or brown, cis or queer, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, indigenous, who did not descend from the global mixing of Afro-Asians, Proto-Indo Europeans and Asian-Amerindians in the Caucasus Region in the 15th Century. There is not a single human child born in the next 100 years who will not be a member of the forming super-continent - Amasia. We are one people on one planet, with infinite positive expressions - and zero possible sound arguments that logically support racism, war or inequity.

	 - 4. How did the errors of racism, war and inequity come to exist? These mistakes stem from colonialist crimes in the 15th Century which illegally extracted wealth, lands, tools, culture and lives from the Amerindians and deposited it in Europe. There are a growing number of legal precedents articulating and resisting the lack of legal legitimacy. They are few who openly do the right thing; but so many know what the right thing is and do nothing. Why?

	 - 5.¬† Inequity takes a toll for even those who can manage to reap small benefits - the working class and middle class. ¬†They are exhausted and discouraged from learning and growing their human creative potential and participating in the complexification of the planet. Industrialization incentivizes specialization and self-repression. Thus, we have humans who can only think in terms of power, fame, work, money and consumption. Some wither away into nothing; others become oppressive, their identity dependent on the domination of others. Both perpetuate a stunted culture caused by the same problem - a cycle of specialization, consumption, undereducation and self destruction.  The only humane response in this situation is to call for Universal Basic Income, Health Care, Arts-based Education, a Civic Internet Infrastructure, restoration of the resources of the Commons and a public knowledge system. This can be funded in part via a wealth tax implemented through mixed means.

	 - 6. Today there are numerous existing proofs, metrics and evidence for accurately measuring and producing social equity from individual to multi-regional scale. Much of the solutions to today‚Äôs problems were already written in the 1970‚Äôs and then deconstructed by the Reaganomics of the 1980‚Äôs. They can be accurately valued in their regenerative effects on society and flexibly implemented using newer ethical technologies with trained operators. In this time of great fragility, we also have the capacity to produce a more resilient equality than ever before in history.

	 - 7. With recent intellectual and technological advances, all transactions and markets, including the art market, past, present and possible - can be accurately measured in terms of a single universal statistical law; the Law of Net Negentropy. The Law of Net Negentropy governs the very conditions of the physical possibility to transact any possible material or informational object in any system on Earth.     

	 - 9. Because of this law, our Earth has evolved from barren cosmic dust. Because of this law, I am here now, standing before you and speaking. Because of this law, Thomas More wrote 500 years ago in Utopia that an economy which valued iron for its physical use more than gold was a clear sign of an equitable society. And because of this law, we know that .1% of them cannot stop 6.9 billion of us living, speaking and organizing and fighting -until we are worth more than gold.

	 - Selma's parts:
		 - I am not getting what I want until I get it.

		 - How to pass all the abstucals if there is no way to beat them.

		 - Are there solutions to all of my problems. How could I break the cycle of stigma? How could I became just an artist?

		 - Here the city makes no sense, and the people are angry. My friend was the one who told me that there is a solution for everything and that you have to make a plan. But think about those who do not have the capacity of infrastructure to believe since their lives are the heavy reality surrounded by serious existence. I wonder how you expect a broke, sad person without a house, no money, no health insurance, and hungry to be strong - and how then this person has to believe in him or herself. To achieve better life they do need money, or if you think that they do not need money, then why are you not destroying capitalism. Why do we still pay for the air we breathe?

		 - There are so many yet no solutions on how we make the world a better place? How do we try to make all of us be together and equal but with the right to equality? My mother is a hero. Once upon a time, she told me that having your wallet is your power. As a child, you are thought to have money which will make you be good. And all of us, in this or another way, is material. As for the war issues. Why do we still have to fight? Why there are so many languages in the world, and none can be used for peaceful talk? Aren't we a nation who invented so many things, yet we failed to be good to each other? Why you are an evil man if you can be a good man. Let's do this, think that all of this happening on Earth is just dust, and from a very long distance up, in many cases, this reality even does not exist.

		 - I am standing here as a stranger to you, telling you, change your life. But, who am I? Why in the million of milio souls you will find yourself alone and you will say that yet no one understand you. Here, I come, yes you will say another white person. But, do you really want to know me? Do you want to know why I do not want to segregate myself and put my self in the box even when instittusion like this wants to put you in the box. I am staning here to free myself from the chanis of the art world which is counting on the crises to make other unvisible artists visible. I am standing here to tell you as a Roma woman I will not look into your fortitude nether I will put a scarf on my head to please you. I will do opsite, I will tell you that now this permanent other exist in this moment as a human beaing capable to be a Queen. And yes I am the queen.

		 - My life was not an easy but look here I am, you are applauding in my name in the sake of my revolution, and I know I am not alone. My brothers and sisters, I had have many dreams which I made tru, but I also have a dream that once day, we will not live in the capitalism and that the vaule of human beaing will be measured by their skills, capacity and thoughts but not by money.

	 - Be blue if they want you to be white, be pink if they want you to be black. Shout out and say the truth. What is the truth and for what are we fighting for today?

	 - Many times, I feel that life is simply a sea of passing abstractions, and that what we are really creating is simply a hope to not lose more.¬† We are a new generation - and we have the possibility of bringing an unprecedented world peace. And yet, why, at this time, are we made helpless with a war that is so nonsensical?

	 - It is because peace was never designed into our society. People ask me if I am happy in my life and I must say, on a personal level, I sometimes feel so. But when I think about all of us, about collective trauma, about the women who are fighting simply to live, then how could I be happy?

	 - I am standing here as a stranger to you, telling you, change your life. But, who am I? Here, I come, yes you will say - just another white person. But, do you really want to know me? Do you want to know why I do not want to segregate myself and put myself in the box, even when institutions like this want to put you in a box? I am standing here to free myself from the chains of the art world, which is counting on the crises to make other invisible artists visible.

	 - I am standing here to tell you as a Roma woman, that I will not look into your fortune - nor will I put a scarf on my head to please you. I will do the opposite - I will tell you that now this permanent other exists in this moment as a human being - capable of being a Queen. And yes I am the queen.

	 - Are there solutions to all of my problems. How could I break the cycle of stigma? How could I became just an artist? I am not stopping until I get what I want.

	 - In life, there are always challenges and where there are challenges there are those who struggle. Despite all the progress of this century and the fact that there are now billions of fellow humans - we still do not have equality.

	 - We have so much innovation and so little wisdom. Today we have solar energy, nuclear power, and spaceships that can fly to the moon - yet evil, corruption and injustice still exist. Why there are so many languages in the world, and none can be used for peaceful talk?

	 - Justice, Justice, Justice. We know in many situations, there is no justice. But we also know that we can not give up. We are free to find our position in this world. To be free means to fight knowing that the fight is not about losing or winning - it is about trying to understand what is positioning us to fight. It is because of a lack of understanding that we fight each other freely; and it is in our fight to understand each other do we find freedom together.

	 - ‚Äî----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	 - That is why today, we must fight to understand, to learn, and to build. We are in a moment in history in which we are poised between **crisis and possibility**.1.

Industrialization incentivizes specialization and self-repression. Thus, we have humans who can only think in terms of power, fame, work, money and consumption.
