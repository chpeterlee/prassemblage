- [[negentropy]] refers to the constant negation of entropy occurring in all physical systems of the universe at a minimum rate of 10^10 times per second resulting in a universal complexification of all systems over time. This produces the [[Negentropic Principle]] and the [[4. Law of Net Negentropy & the Lumic Turn]].

- Negentropy refers to the constant negation of entropy occurring in all physical systems of the universe at a minimum rate of 10^10 times per second resulting in a universal complexification of all systems over time. This produces the [[Negentropic Principle]] and the [[4. Law of Net Negentropy & the Lumic Turn]].
- The concept and phrase "**negative entropy**" was introduced by [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) in his 1944 popular-science book __[What is Life?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_is_Life%3F_%28Schr%C3%B6dinger%29)__1(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropy#cite_note-1) Later, [Léon Brillouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Brillouin) shortened the phrase to __negentropy__.

- In chapter VI Schrödinger states: "...living matter, while not eluding the "laws of physics" as established up to date, is likely to involve "other laws of physics" hitherto unknown, which however, once they have been revealed, will form just as integral a part of science as the former."
- He knows that this statement is open to misconception and tries to clarify it. The main principle involved with "order-from-disorder" is the [second law of thermodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics), according to which [entropy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) only increases in a closed system (such as the universe). Schrödinger explains that living matter evades the decay to [thermodynamical equilibrium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamical_equilibrium) by homeostatically maintaining [negative entropy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_and_life#Negative_entropy) in an open system.
- In chapter VII, he maintains that "order-from-order" is not absolutely new to physics; in fact, it is even simpler and more plausible. But nature follows "order-from-disorder", with some exceptions as the movement of the [celestial bodies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_bodies) and the behaviour of mechanical devices such as clocks. But even those are influenced by thermal and frictional forces. The degree to which a system functions mechanically or statistically depends on the temperature. If heated, a clock ceases to function, because it melts. Conversely, if the temperature approaches [absolute zero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero), any system behaves more and more mechanically. Some systems approach this mechanical behaviour rather fast with room temperature already being practically equivalent to absolute zero.
- In 1974, [Albert Szent-Györgyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Szent-Gy%C3%B6rgyi) proposed replacing the term __negentropy__ with __syntropy__. That term may have originated in the 1940s with the Italian mathematician [Luigi Fantappiè](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Fantappi%C3%A8), who tried to construct a unified theory of [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology) and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics). [Buckminster Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller) tried to popularize this usage, but __negentropy__ remains common.
