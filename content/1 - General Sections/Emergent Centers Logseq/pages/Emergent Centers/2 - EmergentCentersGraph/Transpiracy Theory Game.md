- Transpiracy Theory is a decentralized meta-theory game produced both by darkweb and lightweb academics, activists, artists and organizers working with and without artificial intelligences (also known as the [[Planetary Research Assemblage]])((749d3f5c-304e-4226-8fba-edce24c4a92c)). Their work integrates pre-existing theories across cultures, religions, sub-cultures and communities with an indefinite universal physical medium (some people refer to this as Transteria or Aether or Quantum Chemistry). It is associated with the growth of Realismo Planetario but it is not necessarily adherent to it.

	 - The [[Planetary Research Assemblage]]:
id:: 749d3f5c-304e-4226-8fba-edce24c4a92c
		 - An assemblage of artists, activists, academics and inventors, both light and darkweb, across the planet.

		 - No single person has full authority of the group; any given statement is an open-source interpretation of the following ethos:

		 - 1. Autonomy, Solidarity, Sharing, Creativity are the core foundations of a functioning planet.

		 - 2. Thinking and coordinating as a planet requires a language of 7 time-scales:

		 - - Cosmic

		 - - Solar

		 - - Geologic

		 - - City-State (usually a 3 tier metropolitan area)

		 - - Governmental / language-based

		 - - Organizational / image-based

		 - - Individual / computational

		 - 3. Proxy politics is required to operate at these scales
4. Art is required to connect trans-culturally across environmental differences, then technological knowledge to accurately pose problems, then contextual knowledge to mediate into existing community circulations.

		 - **A Planetary Reality Game played with superpositional artists and artworks, both real and fictional which has been known to generate 3b. ðŸ›¹ Say Less Theory Games**

		 - A game of art in which:

		 - 1. No pre existing art theory is necessary to be remembered, forgotten or created but can be.

		 - 2. Every artist and artwork, both real and fictional, contains a different aspect of the same universe producing new forms of itself both predictably and unpredictably at the speed of light.

		 - 3. There is no winning or losing but there is more and less interesting depending on arbitrary goals which may or may not be defined.

		 - 4. Each artwork affirms a new audience that doesn't exist yet and a new audience that doesn't exist yet is the object of each artwork superposing both new and old audiences and artworks. All past, present and possible artworks exist in superposition and - all possible states simultaneously.

		 - According to fragmented net ephemera - he is sworn to utter invisibility. Anyone claiming to be the 7th Swan is automatically disqualified. 


		 - He releases his art, philosophy and inventions through semi-visible interventions into the information circulations of the ~7,000,000 humans with generalist inventor skills or potential.
