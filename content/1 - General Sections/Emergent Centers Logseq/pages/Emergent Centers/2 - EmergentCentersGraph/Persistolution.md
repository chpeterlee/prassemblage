- Based on the [[Persistence art]] movements and technologies of persistence, particularly the use of [[persistent state]] systems. It is driven primarily by what most the [[Postworking Class]] and [[Postwork Majority]] don’t know.
- Members include those who are not dead yet and persist, or those who’s memories or potential energy persists.
- They exist in quantum superposition, inferrable via various means.
- The [[Inclusive Scalability]] of various [[inference]]s can be verified via [[Statistical Review]].

- Persistence is Resistance! The Rise of "Persistence Art"! Viva La Persistolución!
- 1. Persistence, or simply the praxis and theory of not dying every second - is the ultimate horizon of resistance, bar none.
- 2. Why? Because persistence is truly what unites us. Persistence in the face of today's massive entropy, fragility and stupidity is heroic. And in this context, the persistence of skill, knowledge, memory, functional tools and a state of not-dead-yet, is truly commendable.
- 3. Indeed in today's deskilled, undereducated and unethical social ecology, the only thing forecastable is massive amounts of entropy, fragility and waste. Hence while not necessarily forsaking traditional modes of mobilization - we should recognize and utilize our true secret weapon - persistence itself.
- 4. Thus let us celebrate what we have insisted on persisting - and allow various persistence algorithms to then infer effective proxy resistance from our invincible, invisible and unaware persistence!
- 5. Viva la Persistolución!
- 6. Happens in the space between the unimaginable and not thinking.
