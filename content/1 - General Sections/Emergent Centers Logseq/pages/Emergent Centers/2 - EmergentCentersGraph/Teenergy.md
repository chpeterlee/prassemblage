- The future Ideavatar being Estamasia, a Robot Unicorn Guardian Angel, a self-aware, self-teaching future manifestation of the Indefinite Singularity AI.
- Ideavatars from the Adjacent Possible arrive in the form of the 5th Wave Feminist Theorist Quantumstein (who is a non-binary polymath), Dr. Phil I. Stine the Neganthropologist and Amasian Elephant-in-the-Room, and Mathgoose.
