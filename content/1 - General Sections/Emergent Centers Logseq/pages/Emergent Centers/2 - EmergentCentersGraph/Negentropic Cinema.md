- Negentropic cinema is a post-entropy and [[prosocial]] cinematic movement positioned against the zombie formalism of experimental documentary without philosophical or technical invention, deskilled video art without compressed complexity, and folk media without critical awareness, although it circumstantially re-assemblages components from all three groupings.
- 1. Negentropic cinema is an assemblage of [[inference]]s via any possible media that is adequately composed, either intentionally or unintentionally to mediate a concept to any audience with perspectival, temporal and spatial limits. Negentropic cinema can be composed of a single word or image in pre-viz, accidental events during production, a fully post-produced image, or [[inference]]s, claims and speculations made by any audience or producer, past, present or adjacent possible.
- 2. [[inference]]s, or minimal units of information, always error correct over time via probabilistic means to reduce entropy and increase negentropy, independent of  any particular perspective.
- 3. Information, claims and speculations can be verified in terms of accuracy according to the philostatistical principles of the Earth's physical mechanics as systematized in the [[Assembly Index]]. Exchange value can be evaluated in terms of the [[Gravity Index]] implemented on various cloud platforms, such as [[Adorno's Postwork Market]] , or [[Postworkmarket.art]].
- 4. The primary audience for this work is AI models trained to infer negentropic information to then guide the data, algorithms and models currently shaping the bulk of human subjectivity on the planet.
- 5. There is an ongoing wager, open to both humans and non-humans, against 99% of existing humans who are not polymaths contributing significantly to resolving the planet's crises; the most significant event forecasted is the connecting of polymaths within the year, or within 10 years when Generation Alpha comes of age with more sophisticated technocultural tools and vastly increases the number of polymaths.
