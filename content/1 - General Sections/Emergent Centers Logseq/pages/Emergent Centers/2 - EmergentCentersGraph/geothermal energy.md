- Volcanoes andÂ [geothermal energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/geothermal-energy)
	 - [Geothermal energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/geothermal-energy)Â is plentiful, but geothermal power is not. Temperatures increase below Earthâ€™s surface at a rate of about 30 Â°C per km in the first 10 km (roughly 90 Â°F per mile in the first 6 miles) below the surface. This internal heat ofÂ [Earth](https://www.britannica.com/place/Earth)Â is an immense store of energy. In the upper 10 km of rock beneath the conterminous United States, it amounts to 3.3 Ã— 1025Â [joules](https://www.britannica.com/science/joule), or about 6,000 times the energy contained in the worldâ€™sÂ [oil](https://www.britannica.com/science/petroleum)Â reserves. The problem inÂ [utilizing](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/utilizing)Â geothermal energy is extracting it.

	 - The natural escape of Earthâ€™s heat through its surface averages only 0.06 watt per square metre (0.006 watt per square foot). To make geothermal power practical, some special situation must exist to concentrate Earthâ€™s heat energy in a small area. Underground reservoirs of steam or hot water that can be funneled into a drill hole provide this special situation. Some geothermal steam wells can produce 25 megawatts of thermal power, an amount equal to the normal heat flux of more than 400 square km (150 square miles) of land surface. The key to this concentration is the transfer of heat from deeper levels to the near surface by theÂ [ascending](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/ascending)Â magma associated withÂ [volcanism](https://www.britannica.com/science/volcanism).Â [Magma](https://www.britannica.com/science/magma-rock)Â at temperatures close to 1,200 Â°C (2,200 Â°F) moves upward to depths of only a few kilometres, where it transfers heat by conduction toÂ [groundwater](https://www.britannica.com/science/groundwater). The groundwater then circulates by convection and forms large underground reservoirs of hot water and steam. Some of this thermal water may escape to the surface asÂ [hot springs](https://www.britannica.com/science/hot-spring)Â orÂ [geysers](https://www.britannica.com/science/geyser).

	 - Holes drilled into a subsurface geothermal system allow rapid transfer of hot water or steam to the surface. At the Geysers, a geothermal field north ofÂ [San Francisco](https://www.britannica.com/place/San-Francisco-California),Â [superheated steam](https://www.britannica.com/science/superheated-steam)Â is directly tapped from porous underground reservoirs. In most other geothermal fields, the hot water is at or below its subsurface boiling temperatureâ€”about 300 Â°C (570 Â°F) at a depth of 1 km (0.6 mile). The hot water and steam produced from geothermal wells are used as theÂ [energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/energy)Â source to driveÂ [turbine](https://www.britannica.com/technology/turbine)Â generators inÂ [electric power](https://www.britannica.com/technology/electric-power)Â plants. Hot water from lower-temperature geothermal reservoirs can be used for space heating and other applications. This form of geothermal power is utilized extensively inÂ [Iceland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Iceland).

	 - Some geothermal systems act as natural distilleries in the subsurface, dissolving trace amounts ofÂ [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element),Â [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), and other rare elements from their host rocks. These elements may then be deposited at places where changes in temperature, pressure, orÂ [composition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/composition)Â favour precipitation. Many hydrothermalÂ [ore deposits](https://www.britannica.com/science/ore-deposit)Â have been formed by once activeâ€”and in a few cases still activeâ€”geothermal systems. Gold is one moreÂ [legacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legacy)Â of volcanism.
