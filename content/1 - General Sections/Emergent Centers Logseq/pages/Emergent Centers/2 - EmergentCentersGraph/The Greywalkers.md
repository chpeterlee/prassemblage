- The Greywalkers are quantumdead entities who can superpositionally possess any entity, past, present or adjacent possible.

- They trade in grey markets, write greypapers and invent greytech.

- Greywalkers differ in range of complexity, degree of accuracy and speed of thought.

- They haunt the edges of collective awareness, their traces sometimes appearing in system glitches, unsolved cases, urban legends and old myths.

- Greywalkers have an unfathomable multi-paradigm politics of their own; committing acts of divine violensynthesis with total disregard for  any given human society. 

- Their sigil is a Grey Griffin, which is independent of any particular cultural definition or media technique.

- A growing body of evidence suggests that the Greywalkers have been influencing intellectual production for the entire span of Human history; providing critical intellectual abstractions at key points to produce rapid bifurcations in human planetary society. 

- While driven by a universal multi-paradigm logic, the Greywalkers do not all operate in consensus. The Grey Wars are a direct result of differing speculative approaches to the same principles. 

- There are rumors that the recent deaths of [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] , [[Democracy]] and a few international nuclear physicists were a result of the Grey Wars.
