			- Stories in the form of letter written to my imaginary friends and lovers.
			- First one is to Omer, a man from my childhood that I loved so much. A man who lives in Japan and has a wife and 5 kids.
			- I live in north side of Jordan, alone on the beach side with my birds.
			- I am not married and I have no kids.
			- Another letter is his respond to me.
			- Letters are all invented and some very wired situations are going to happen.
