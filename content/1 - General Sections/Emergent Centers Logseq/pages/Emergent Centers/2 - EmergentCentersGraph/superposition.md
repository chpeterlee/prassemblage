	- **Quantum superposition**Â is a fundamental principle ofÂ [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics). It states that, much likeÂ [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave)Â inÂ [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle#Wave_superposition), any two (or more)Â [quantum states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state)Â can be added together ("superposed") and the result will be another valid quantum state; and conversely, that every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more other distinct states. Mathematically, it refers to a property ofÂ [solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state)Â to theÂ [SchrÃ¶dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation); since the SchrÃ¶dinger equation isÂ [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear), anyÂ [linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination)Â of solutions will also be a solution.
	- An example of a physically observable manifestation of the wave nature of quantum systems is theÂ [interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_%28wave_propagation%29)Â peaks from anÂ [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron)Â beam in aÂ [double-slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment). The pattern is very similar to the one obtained byÂ [diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction)Â of classical waves.
	- Another example is a quantum logicalÂ [qubit state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit#Qubit_states), as used inÂ [quantum information processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_processing), which is a quantum superposition of the "basis states"Â {\displaystyle |0\rangle }![|0\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed066a3ad158da0ad6d6a421a606b1c8a35eb95b)Â andÂ {\displaystyle |1\rangle }![|1\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f53021ca18e77477ee5bd3c1523e5830189ec5c). HereÂ {\displaystyle |0\rangle }![|0\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed066a3ad158da0ad6d6a421a606b1c8a35eb95b)Â is theÂ [Dirac notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_notation)Â for the quantum state that will always give the result 0 when converted to classical logic by a measurement. LikewiseÂ {\displaystyle |1\rangle }![|1\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f53021ca18e77477ee5bd3c1523e5830189ec5c)Â is the state that will always convert to 1. Contrary to a classicalÂ [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit)Â that can only be in the state corresponding to 0 or the state corresponding to 1, a qubit may be in a superposition of both states. This means that the probabilities of measuring 0 or 1 for a qubit are in general neither 0.0 nor 1.0, and multiple measurements made on qubits in identical states will not always give the same result.

- Concept[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_superposition&action=edit&section=1)]
	- The principle of quantum superposition states that if a physical system may be in one of many configurationsâ€”arrangements of particles or fieldsâ€”then the most general state is a combination of all of these possibilities, where the amount in each configuration is specified by aÂ [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).
	- For example, if there are two configurations labelled by 0 and 1, the most general state would be
	- {\displaystyle c_{0}{\mid }0\rangle +c_{1}{\mid }1\rangle }![{\displaystyle c_{0}{\mid }0\rangle +c_{1}{\mid }1\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dce7517939a363a58d780f90fd04ab537ec516e9)
	- where the coefficients are complex numbers describing how much goes into each configuration.
	- The principle was described byÂ [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac)Â as follows:
	- The general principle of superposition of quantum mechanics applies to the states [that are theoretically possible without mutual interference or contradiction] ... of any one dynamical system. It requires us to assume that between these states there exist peculiar relationships such that whenever the system is definitely in one state we can consider it as being partly in each of two or more other states. The original state must be regarded as the result of a kind of superposition of the two or more new states, in a way that cannot be conceived on classical ideas. Any state may be considered as the result of a superposition of two or more other states, and indeed in an infinite number of ways. Conversely, any two or more states may be superposed to give a new state...
	- The non-classical nature of the superposition process is brought out clearly if we consider the superposition of two states,Â __A__Â andÂ __B__, such that there exists an observation which, when made on the system in stateÂ __A__, is certain to lead to one particular result,Â __a__Â say, and when made on the system in stateÂ __B__Â is certain to lead to some different result,Â __b__Â say. What will be the result of the observation when made on the system in the superposed state? The answer is that the result will be sometimesÂ __a__Â and sometimesÂ __b__, according to a probability law depending on the relative weights ofÂ __A__Â andÂ __B__Â in the superposition process. It will never be different from bothÂ __a__Â andÂ __b__Â [i.e., eitherÂ __a__Â orÂ __b__].Â __The intermediate character of the state formed by superposition thus expresses itself through the probability of a particular result for an observation being intermediate between the corresponding probabilities for the original states, not through the result itself being intermediate between the corresponding results for the original states.__[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-Dirac1947-1)
	- [Anton Zeilinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Zeilinger), referring to the prototypical example of theÂ [double-slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment), has elaborated regarding the creation and destruction of quantum superposition:
	- "[T]he superposition of amplitudes ... is only valid if there is no way to know, even in principle, which path the particle took. It is important to realize that this does not imply that an observer actually takes note of what happens. It is sufficient to destroy the interference pattern, if the path information is accessible in principle from the experiment or even if it is dispersed in the environment and beyond any technical possibility to be recovered, but in principle still â€˜â€˜out there.â€™â€™ The absence of any such information isÂ __the essential criterion__Â for quantum interference to appear.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-Zeilinger-2)
- Theory[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_superposition&action=edit&section=2)]
- Examples[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_superposition&action=edit&section=3)]
	- For an equation describing a physical phenomenon, the superposition principle states that a combination of solutions to a linear equation is also a solution of it. When this is true the equation is said to obey the superposition principle. Thus, ifÂ [state vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state)Â __f__1,Â __f__2Â andÂ __f__3Â each solve theÂ [linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation)Â onÂ Ïˆ, thenÂ Ïˆ =Â __c__1â€‰__f__1Â +Â __c__2â€‰__f__2Â +Â __c__3â€‰__f__3Â would also be a solution, in which eachÂ __c__Â is a coefficient. TheÂ [SchrÃ¶dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation)Â is linear, so quantum mechanics follows this.
	- For example, consider anÂ [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron)Â with two possible configurations: up and down. This describes the physical system of aÂ [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit).
	- {\displaystyle c_{1}{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +c_{2}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle }![{\displaystyle c_{1}{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +c_{2}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c70e3f4154d8f2974e8ab95d2bd7d6a022712ec)
	- is the most general state. But these coefficients dictate probabilities for the system to be in either configuration. The probability for a specified configuration is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient. The probabilities must add to 1, since the electron must be in one of those two states.
	- {\displaystyle p_{\text{up}}={\mid }c_{1}{\mid }^{2}}![{\displaystyle p_{\text{up}}={\mid }c_{1}{\mid }^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b7436bdde95f0785fb26a5ffdf324a3108f1bb7){\displaystyle p_{\text{down}}={\mid }c_{2}\mid ^{2}}![{\displaystyle p_{\text{down}}={\mid }c_{2}\mid ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57a50ced1597c587141ba2c6b5e0b4fa6522ec29){\displaystyle p_{\text{up or down}}=p_{\text{up}}+p_{\text{down}}=1}![ p_\text{up or down} = p_\text{up} + p_\text{down} = 1 ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7985e2cb5b2f2655966538f4c6667012846b5c59)
	- Continuing with this example, if a particle can be in state Â up and Â down, it can also be in a state where it is an amountÂ 3__i__/5Â up and an amountÂ 4/5Â down.
	- {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle ={3 \over 5}i{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +{4 \over 5}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle .}![{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle ={3 \over 5}i{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +{4 \over 5}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/faf0b3d742c6c02cc70c71d71edafc684d39fbc1)
	- In this, the probability for up isÂ {\displaystyle \left|{\frac {3i}{5}}\right|^{2}={\frac {9}{25}}}![{\displaystyle \left|{\frac {3i}{5}}\right|^{2}={\frac {9}{25}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bec40faeb76755fe2479346f8ca0d51c412d96f9). The probability for down isÂ {\displaystyle \left|{\frac {4}{5}}\right|^{2}={\frac {16}{25}}}![{\displaystyle \left|{\frac {4}{5}}\right|^{2}={\frac {16}{25}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/029e29c7c44cbfd5df04da89ac0f7389db71fc83). Note thatÂ {\displaystyle {\frac {9}{25}}+{\frac {16}{25}}=1}![\frac{9}{25}+\frac{16}{25}=1](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/893a91a660da50666cada3d6ebf6ed289e3c1d7f).
	- In the description, only the relative size of the different components matter, and their angle to each other on the complex plane. This is usually stated by declaring that two states which are a multiple of one another are the same as far as the description of the situation is concerned. Either of these describe the same state for any nonzeroÂ {\displaystyle \alpha }![\alpha ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3)
	- {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle \approx \alpha |\psi \rangle }![
	  |\psi \rangle \approx \alpha |\psi \rangle
	  ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec3492209aefb19cd6d880c8ebcb0a00ed3d12b8)
	- The fundamental law of quantum mechanics is that the evolution isÂ [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear), meaning that if state A turns into Aâ€² and B turns into Bâ€² after 10 seconds, then after 10 seconds the superpositionÂ {\displaystyle \psi }![\psi ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45e5789e5d9c8f7c79744f43ecaaf8ba42a8553a)Â turns into a mixture of Aâ€² and Bâ€² with the sameÂ [coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficients)Â as A and B.
	- For example, if we have the following
	- {\displaystyle {\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle \to {\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle }![{\displaystyle {\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle \to {\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/486b2dff87c8ad79a544d2b906ee845f7425d1f0){\displaystyle {\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle \to {\frac {3i}{5}}{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +{\frac {4}{5}}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle }![{\displaystyle {\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle \to {\frac {3i}{5}}{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +{\frac {4}{5}}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/789aedc7439ac40266a309d50cbf393e801a04d2)
	- Then after those 10 seconds our state will change to
	- {\displaystyle c_{1}{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +c_{2}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle \to c_{1}\left({\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle \right)+c_{2}\left({\frac {3i}{5}}{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +{\frac {4}{5}}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle \right)}![{\displaystyle c_{1}{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +c_{2}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle \to c_{1}\left%28{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle \right%29+c_{2}\left%28{\frac {3i}{5}}{\mid }{\uparrow }\rangle +{\frac {4}{5}}{\mid }{\downarrow }\rangle \right%29}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e9a74133b4bcbca167d3b7905310670b9044ea9)
	- So far there have just been 2 configurations, but there can be infinitely many.
	- In illustration, a particle can have any position, so that there are different configurations which have any value of the positionÂ __x__. These are written:
	- {\displaystyle |x\rangle }![
	  |x\rangle
	  ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48004887d8f9dfc489bd2bc793780b7f1d8039ad)
	- The principle of superposition guarantees that there are states which are arbitrary superpositions of all the positions with complex coefficients:
	- {\displaystyle \sum _{x}\psi (x)|x\rangle }![
	  \sum_x \psi%28x%29 |x\rangle
	  ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d0becd373444f790dc34055d3ab847857b0ae24d)
	- This sum is defined only if the indexÂ __x__Â is discrete. If the index is overÂ {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }![\reals](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc), then the sum is replaced by an integral. The quantityÂ {\displaystyle \psi (x)}![\psi %28x%29](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a596a1fb4130a47f6b88c66150497338bd6cbccc)Â is called theÂ [wavefunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefunction)Â of the particle.
	- If we consider a qubit with both position and spin, the state is a superposition of all possibilities for both:
	- {\displaystyle \sum _{x}\psi _{+}(x)|x,{\uparrow }\rangle +\psi _{-}(x)|x,{\downarrow }\rangle \,}![{\displaystyle \sum _{x}\psi _{+}%28x%29|x,{\uparrow }\rangle +\psi _{-}%28x%29|x,{\downarrow }\rangle \,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/548dd888d1807d692b0bba22456566522b819472)
	- The configuration space of a quantum mechanical system cannot be worked out without some physical knowledge. The input is usually the allowed different classical configurations, but without the duplication of including both position and momentum.
	- A pair of particles can be in any combination of pairs of positions. A state where one particle is at position x and the other is at position y is writtenÂ {\displaystyle |x,y\rangle }![|x,y\rangle](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1e8bfdd9ef4a4414b96d21742fc4cd03ba970d0). The most general state is a superposition of the possibilities:
	- {\displaystyle \sum _{xy}A(x,y)|x,y\rangle \,}![
	  \sum_{xy} A%28x,y%29 |x,y\rangle
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b1167370a97e972707671b23add6bfa121c167e3)
	- The description of the two particles is much larger than the description of one particleâ€”it is a function in twice the number of dimensions. This is also true in probability, when the statistics of two random variables areÂ [correlated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlated). If two particles are uncorrelated, the probability distribution for their joint positionÂ P(__x__,â€‰__y__)Â is a product of the probability of finding one at one position and the other at the other position:
	- {\displaystyle P(x,y)=P_{x}(x)P_{y}(y)\,}![
	  P%28x,y%29 = P_x %28x%29 P_y%28y%29
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a9de375dfd6475fe28b091c40a0be042b3cf5df)
	- This means that the wave functionÂ {\displaystyle A(x,y)}![A%28x,y%29](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/301b7810250db19125d15b511054cc06fd5f9a2f)Â of the system can be represented as a product of the wave functionsÂ {\displaystyle \psi _{x}(x)}![{\displaystyle \psi _{x}%28x%29}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fccae5185be0f4b98311ddd7fe5565caa16b5787)Â andÂ {\displaystyle \psi _{y}(y)}![{\displaystyle \psi _{y}%28y%29}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35e88d5457bd8b528d0416cabc20ac85b3c401cc)Â of its parts:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-3)
	- {\displaystyle A(x,y)=\psi _{x}(x)\psi _{y}(y)\,}![
	  A%28x,y%29 = \psi_x%28x%29\psi_y%28y%29
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e8c822973bd491c42acb530ce5e129d238a45e1c).
	- In 1927, Heitler and London,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-4)Â attempted to quantitatively mechanically calculate the ground steady state of the H2Â molecule. The calculations were based on theÂ **quantum superposition**Â of the two hydrogen atoms that make up the system - H2Â molecule. The success of this attempt became the basis for all further development ofÂ [covalent bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond).
- Analogy with probability[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_superposition&action=edit&section=4)]
	- InÂ [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory)Â there is a similar principle. If a system has a probabilistic description, this description gives the probability of any configuration, and given any two different configurations, there is a state which is partly this and partly that, with positive real number coefficients, the probabilities, which say how much of each there is.
	- For example, if we have a probability distribution for where a particle is, it is described by the "state"
	- {\displaystyle \sum _{x}\rho (x)|x\rangle }![
	  \sum_x \rho%28x%29 |x\rangle
	  ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a1fda4c92361c8629806cf0b1b5513092e7afa1f)
	- WhereÂ {\displaystyle \rho }![\rho ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64)Â is theÂ [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function), a positive number that measures the probability that the particle will be found at a certain location.
	- The evolution equation is also linear in probability, for fundamental reasons. If the particle has some probability for going from positionÂ __x__Â toÂ __y__, and fromÂ __z__Â toÂ __y__, the probability of going toÂ __y__Â starting from a state which is half-__x__Â and half-__z__Â is a half-and-half mixture of the probability of going toÂ __y__Â from each of the options. This is the principle of linear superposition in probability.
	- Quantum mechanics is different, because the numbers can be positive or negative. While the complex nature of the numbers is just a doubling, if you consider the real and imaginary parts separately, the sign of the coefficients is important. In probability, two different possible outcomes always add together, so that if there are more options to get to a pointÂ __z__, the probability always goes up. In quantum mechanics, different possibilities can cancel.
	- In probability theory with a finite number of states, the probabilities can always be multiplied by a positive number to make their sum equal to one. For example, if there is a three state probability system:
	- {\displaystyle x|1\rangle +y|2\rangle +z|3\rangle \,}![

	- The geometry of the state space is a revealed to be a triangle. In general it is aÂ [simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex). There are special points in a triangle or simplex corresponding to the corners, and these points are those where one of the probabilities is equal to 1 and the others are zero. These are the unique locations where the position is known with certainty.
	- In a quantum mechanical system with three states, the quantum mechanical wavefunction is a superposition of states again, but this time twice as many quantities with no restriction on the sign:
	- {\displaystyle A|1\rangle +B|2\rangle +C|3\rangle =(A_{r}+iA_{i})|1\rangle +(B_{r}+iB_{i})|2\rangle +(C_{r}+iC_{i})|3\rangle \,}![

	- rescaling the variables so that the sum of the squares is 1, the geometry of the space is revealed to be a high-dimensional sphere

	- A sphere has a large amount of symmetry, it can be viewed in different coordinate systems orÂ [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra). So unlike a probability theory, a quantum theory has a large number of different bases in which it can be equally well described. The geometry of the phase space can be viewed as a hint that the quantity in quantum mechanics which corresponds to the probability is theÂ __absolute square__Â of the coefficient of the superposition.
- Hamiltonian evolution[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_superposition&action=edit&section=5)]
	- The numbers that describe the amplitudes for different possibilities define theÂ [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics), the space of different states. The dynamics describes how these numbers change with time. For a particle that can be in any one of infinitely many discrete positions, a particle on a lattice, the superposition principle tells you how to make a state:
	- {\displaystyle \sum _{n}\psi _{n}|n\rangle \,}![
	  \sum_n \psi_n |n\rangle
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40747a78241aa459657566d8975ad01e6024dc59)
	- So that the infinite list of amplitudesÂ {\textstyle (\ldots ,\psi _{-2},\psi _{-1},\psi _{0},\psi _{1},\psi _{2},\ldots )}![{\textstyle %28\ldots ,\psi _{-2},\psi _{-1},\psi _{0},\psi _{1},\psi _{2},\ldots %29}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/53bb15e370e4ee37e1cc978678a68bb490f43851)Â completely describes the quantum state of the particle. This list is called theÂ **state vector**, and formally it is an element of aÂ [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space), an infinite-dimensional complexÂ [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space). It is usual to represent the state so that the sum of theÂ [absolute squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_square)Â of the amplitudes is one:
	- {\displaystyle \sum \psi _{n}^{*}\psi _{n}=1}![
	  \sum \psi_n^*\psi_n = 1
	  ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c961aa53e5afefceda75b11a62352bd532be9971)
	- For a particle described by probability theory random walking on a line, the analogous thing is the list of probabilitiesÂ {\textstyle (\ldots ,P_{-2},P_{-1},P_{0},P_{1},P_{2},\ldots )}![{\textstyle %28\ldots ,P_{-2},P_{-1},P_{0},P_{1},P_{2},\ldots %29}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b1bddabc8c2d5f6b9489428d5ab67f32282b2632), which give the probability of any position. The quantities that describe how they change in time are the transition probabilitiesÂ {\displaystyle \scriptstyle K_{x\rightarrow y}(t)}![\scriptstyle K_{x\rightarrow y}%28t%29](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b8854c47f417709631da4ad3f3869a84e1d6b0), which gives the probability that, starting at x, the particle ends up at y time t later. The total probability of ending up at y is given by the sum over all the possibilities
	- {\displaystyle P_{y}(t_{0}+t)=\sum _{x}P_{x}(t_{0})K_{x\rightarrow y}(t)\,}![
	  P_y%28t_0+t%29 = \sum_x P_x%28t_0%29 K_{x\rightarrow y}%28t%29
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2bfd863e7d9d68533a77641e298d496637bcfa9b)
	- The condition of conservation of probability states that starting at any x, the total probability to end upÂ __somewhere__Â must add up to 1:
	- {\displaystyle \sum _{y}K_{x\rightarrow y}=1\,}![
	  \sum_y K_{x\rightarrow y} = 1
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/672f074eec2fde883c01828d3a29d54356de5da3)
	- So that the total probability will be preserved, K is what is called aÂ [stochastic matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix).
	- When no time passes, nothing changes: for 0 elapsed timeÂ {\displaystyle \scriptstyle K{x\rightarrow y}(0)=\delta _{xy}}![\scriptstyle K{x\rightarrow y}%280%29 = \delta_{xy} ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83a63f61f7650c2f53aab84d1853a88d4e558716), the K matrix is zero except from a state to itself. So in the case that the time is short, it is better to talk about the rate of change of the probability instead of the absolute change in the probability.
	- {\displaystyle P_{y}(t+dt)=P_{y}(t)+dt\,\sum _{x}P_{x}R_{x\rightarrow y}\,}![{\displaystyle P_{y}%28t+dt%29=P_{y}%28t%29+dt\,\sum _{x}P_{x}R_{x\rightarrow y}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3de4716022786c188c2a9f72ff3c67bf79702e6)
	- whereÂ {\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{x\rightarrow y}}![\scriptstyle R_{x\rightarrow y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0cb8adaa0d0164a8cecbdaf56ec0dbdd811226d)Â is the time derivative of the K matrix:
	- {\displaystyle R_{x\rightarrow y}={K_{x\rightarrow y}\,dt-\delta _{xy} \over dt}.\,}![{\displaystyle R_{x\rightarrow y}={K_{x\rightarrow y}\,dt-\delta _{xy} \over dt}.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e3808444f17c8c098849a16f2dd436b20651c12)
	- The equation for the probabilities is a differential equation that is sometimes called theÂ **master equation**:
	- {\displaystyle {dP_{y} \over dt}=\sum _{x}P_{x}R_{x\rightarrow y}\,}![
	  {dP_y \over dt} = \sum_x P_x R_{x\rightarrow y}
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fec382ed3c8ab8133794d0fede10b96c4009fc5d)
	- The R matrix is the probability per unit time for the particle to make a transition from x to y. The condition that the K matrix elements add up to one becomes the condition that the R matrix elements add up to zero:
	- {\displaystyle \sum _{y}R_{x\rightarrow y}=0\,}![
	  \sum_y R_{x\rightarrow y} = 0
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1fab44f2ca9af13dbcbcb0ecbf46d65bc277d072)
	- One simple case to study is when the R matrix has an equal probability to go one unit to the left or to the right, describing a particle that has a constant rate of random walking. In this caseÂ {\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{x\rightarrow y}}![\scriptstyle R_{x\rightarrow y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0cb8adaa0d0164a8cecbdaf56ec0dbdd811226d)Â is zero unless y is eitherÂ __x__Â +Â 1,Â __x__, orÂ __x__Â âˆ’Â 1, whenÂ __y__Â isÂ __x__Â +Â 1 orÂ __x__Â âˆ’Â 1, theÂ __R__Â matrix has valueÂ __c__, and in order for the sum of theÂ __R__Â matrix coefficients to equal zero, the value ofÂ {\displaystyle R_{x\rightarrow x}}![R_{x\rightarrow x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3720614ae7995875ad59713a2a690aea7124327f)Â must be âˆ’2__c__. So the probabilities obey theÂ **discretized diffusion equation**:
	- {\displaystyle {dP_{x} \over dt}=c(P_{x+1}-2P_{x}+P_{x-1})\,}![{\displaystyle {dP_{x} \over dt}=c%28P_{x+1}-2P_{x}+P_{x-1}%29\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8365f307a8a14d1d58096e7b5d5424a65dfa2f7f)
	- which, when c is scaled appropriately and the P distribution is smooth enough to think of the system in a continuum limit becomes:
	- {\displaystyle {\partial P(x,t) \over \partial t}=c{\partial ^{2}P \over \partial x^{2}}\,}![
	  {\partial P%28x,t%29 \over \partial t} = c {\partial^2 P \over \partial x^2 }
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/37a44fd9e36786947ba4f43a3345c8a5002bfc05)
	- Which is theÂ **[diffusion equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation)**.
	- Quantum amplitudes give the rate at which amplitudes change in time, and they are mathematically exactly the same except that they are complex numbers. The analog of the finite time K matrix is called the U matrix:
	- {\displaystyle \psi _{n}(t)=\sum _{m}U_{nm}(t)\psi _{m}\,}![
	  \psi_n%28t%29 = \sum_m U_{nm}%28t%29 \psi_m

	- Since the sum of the absolute squares of the amplitudes must be constant,Â {\displaystyle U}![U](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025)Â must beÂ [unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix):
	- {\displaystyle \sum _{n}U_{nm}^{*}U_{np}=\delta _{mp}\,}![
	  \sum_n U^*_{nm} U_{np} = \delta_{mp}
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b04d510b0e910bca85fc8139b7f9011026c9533c)
	- or, in matrix notation,
	- {\displaystyle U^{\dagger }U=I\,}![
	  U^\dagger U = I
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb8683c9bb09e904432b90edcfd2cf9a30084ac9)
	- The rate of change ofÂ __U__Â is called theÂ [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_%28quantum_mechanics%29)Â __H__, up to a traditional factor ofÂ __i__:
	- {\displaystyle H_{mn}=i{d \over dt}U_{mn}}![
	  H_{mn} = i{d \over dt} U_{mn}
	  ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/89538716ec4b3e4d977cdeb0d45e3b491c889b6d)
	- The Hamiltonian gives the rate at which the particle has an amplitude to go from m to n. The reason it is multiplied by i is that the condition that U is unitary translates to the condition:
	- {\displaystyle (I+iH^{\dagger }\,dt)(I-iH\,dt)=I}![{\displaystyle %28I+iH^{\dagger }\,dt%29%28I-iH\,dt%29=I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9ddaa5fdaefde22be8ff08ec1ce3073761d11aa6){\displaystyle H^{\dagger }-H=0\,}![
	  H^\dagger - H = 0

	- which says that H isÂ [Hermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian). The eigenvalues of the Hermitian matrixÂ __H__Â are real quantities, which have a physical interpretation as energy levels. If the factorÂ __i__Â were absent, the H matrix would be antihermitian and would have purely imaginary eigenvalues, which is not the traditional way quantum mechanics represents observable quantities like the energy.
	- For a particle that has equal amplitude to move left and right, the Hermitian matrix H is zero except for nearest neighbors, where it has the valueÂ __c__. If the coefficient is everywhere constant, the condition thatÂ __H__Â is Hermitian demands that the amplitude to move to the left is the complex conjugate of the amplitude to move to the right. The equation of motion forÂ {\displaystyle \psi }![\psi ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45e5789e5d9c8f7c79744f43ecaaf8ba42a8553a)Â is the time differential equation:
	- {\displaystyle i{d\psi _{n} \over dt}=c^{*}\psi _{n+1}+c\psi _{n-1}}![
	  i{d \psi_n \over dt} = c^* \psi_{n+1} + c \psi_{n-1}
	  ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a98eaecd15b108818a7ee48fc4849436759e182b)
	- In the case in which left and right are symmetric,Â __c__Â is real. By redefining the phase of the wavefunction in time,Â {\displaystyle \psi \rightarrow \psi e^{i2ct}}![ \psi\rightarrow \psi e^{i2ct}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/918ea65c5833d2d1bf64002bc7f238ba6e99b0b5), the amplitudes for being at different locations are only rescaled, so that the physical situation is unchanged. But this phase rotation introduces a linear term.
	- {\displaystyle i{d\psi _{n} \over dt}=c\psi _{n+1}-2c\psi _{n}+c\psi _{n-1},}![{\displaystyle i{d\psi _{n} \over dt}=c\psi _{n+1}-2c\psi _{n}+c\psi _{n-1},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c221a1cf91ed6e9cf4fb7e54dc66a3a41ea7a785)
	- which is the right choice of phase to take the continuum limit. WhenÂ {\displaystyle c}![c](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455)Â is very large andÂ {\displaystyle \psi }![\psi ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45e5789e5d9c8f7c79744f43ecaaf8ba42a8553a)Â is slowly varying so that the lattice can be thought of as a line, this becomes the freeÂ [SchrÃ¶dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation):
	- {\displaystyle i{\partial \psi \over \partial t}=-{\partial ^{2}\psi \over \partial x^{2}}}![
	  i{ \partial \psi \over \partial t } = - {\partial^2 \psi \over \partial x^2}
	  ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b442b6acbd4a74eab552d537e322a3d17eba74b0)
	- If there is an additional term in the H matrix that is an extra phase rotation that varies from point to point, the continuum limit is the SchrÃ¶dinger equation with a potential energy:
	- {\displaystyle i{\partial \psi \over \partial t}=-{\partial ^{2}\psi \over \partial x^{2}}+V(x)\psi }![
	  i{ \partial \psi \over \partial t} = - {\partial^2 \psi \over \partial x^2} + V%28x%29 \psi

- Quantum mechanics in imaginary time[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_superposition&action=edit&section=6)]
	- The analogy between quantum mechanics and probability is very strong, so that there are many mathematical links between them. In a statistical system in discrete time, t=1,2,3, described by a transition matrix for one time stepÂ {\displaystyle \scriptstyle K_{m\rightarrow n}}![\scriptstyle K_{m\rightarrow n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f0f95239d5221f84c7a0e616a30e5d73afe8d720), the probability to go between two points after a finite number of time steps can be represented as a sum over all paths of the probability of taking each path:
	- {\displaystyle K_{x\rightarrow y}(T)=\sum _{x(t)}\prod _{t}K_{x(t)x(t+1)}\,}![
	  K_{x\rightarrow y}%28T%29 = \sum_{x%28t%29} \prod_t K_{x%28t%29x%28t+1%29}
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/92d13160a89addadb49efd526602ab8f0fc44fd6)
	- where the sum extends over all pathsÂ {\displaystyle x(t)}![x%28t%29](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d54c275db3a1e620737b58e143b0818107fa5f5c)Â with the property thatÂ {\displaystyle x(0)=0}![x%280%29=0](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/19f519ea5873571dc27ee09e1a2892a22af7c7a7)Â andÂ {\displaystyle x(T)=y}![x%28T%29=y](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/84200b74641f15d1638d5388e43f939688507e60). The analogous expression in quantum mechanics is theÂ [path integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation).
	- A generic transition matrix in probability has a stationary distribution, which is the eventual probability to be found at any point no matter what the starting point. If there is a nonzero probability for any two paths to reach the same point at the same time, this stationary distribution does not depend on the initial conditions. In probability theory, the probability m for the stochastic matrix obeysÂ [detailed balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance)Â when the stationary distributionÂ {\displaystyle \rho _{n}}![\rho_n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aae86a9b5e3ef50889d51507f5f05a1dd66fd356)Â has the property:
	- {\displaystyle \rho _{n}K_{n\rightarrow m}=\rho _{m}K_{m\rightarrow n}\,}![
	  \rho_n K_{n\rightarrow m} = \rho_m K_{m\rightarrow n}
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/00151bebc795737f2ab040788c23c4ea90c040c9)
	- Detailed balance says that the total probability of going from m to n in the stationary distribution, which is the probability of starting at mÂ {\displaystyle \rho _{m}}![\rho_m](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb8e01f5f9a1ec7641573c415df8bfa942a42a78)Â times the probability of hopping from m to n, is equal to the probability of going from n to m, so that the total back-and-forth flow of probability in equilibrium is zero along any hop. The condition is automatically satisfied when n=m, so it has the same form when written as a condition for the transition-probability R matrix.
	- {\displaystyle \rho _{n}R_{n\rightarrow m}=\rho _{m}R_{m\rightarrow n}\,}![
	  \rho_n R_{n\rightarrow m} = \rho_m R_{m\rightarrow n}
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d223ce594945096e6a2a6108c6412e0e5a84bbfe)
	- When the R matrix obeys detailed balance, the scale of the probabilities can be redefined using the stationary distribution so that they no longer sum to 1:
	- {\displaystyle p'_{n}={\sqrt {\rho _{n}}}\;p_{n}\,}![
	  p'_n = \sqrt{\rho_n}\;p_n
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2caedc8f9c2a3f9fdbe571c38cdb1ea300e885fc)
	- In the new coordinates, the R matrix is rescaled as follows:
	- {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\rho _{n}}}R_{n\rightarrow m}{1 \over {\sqrt {\rho _{m}}}}=H_{nm}\,}![
	  \sqrt{\rho_n} R_{n\rightarrow m} {1\over \sqrt{\rho_m}} = H_{nm}
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/19ff85efd619d63c166ff5492fab4c8ebefbf1c8)
	- and H is symmetric
	- {\displaystyle H_{nm}=H_{mn}\,}![
	  H_{nm} = H_{mn}
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49455da3fa67f150056551e5e729410a2d3f40f5)
	- This matrix H defines a quantum mechanical system:
	- {\displaystyle i{d \over dt}\psi _{n}=\sum H_{nm}\psi _{m}\,}![
	  i{d \over dt} \psi_n = \sum H_{nm} \psi_m
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9cc359bc0c54e915701eae541eb33a86ad8c5424)
	- whose Hamiltonian has the same eigenvalues as those of the R matrix of the statistical system. TheÂ [eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvectors)Â are the same too, except expressed in the rescaled basis. The stationary distribution of the statistical system is theÂ __ground state__Â of the Hamiltonian and it has energy exactly zero, while all the other energies are positive. If H is exponentiated to find the U matrix:
	- {\displaystyle U(t)=e^{-iHt}\,}![
	  U%28t%29 = e^{-iHt}
	  \,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c35103fcb568e949bbfdc522af168abd06219d2)
	- and t is allowed to take on complex values, the K' matrix is found by takingÂ [time imaginary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_time).
	- {\displaystyle K'(t)=e^{-Ht}\,}![
	  K'%28t%29 = e^{-Ht}

	- For quantum systems which are invariant underÂ [time reversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry)Â the Hamiltonian can be made real and symmetric, so that the action of time-reversal on the wave-function is just complex conjugation. If such a Hamiltonian has a unique lowest energy state with a positive real wave-function, as it often does for physical reasons, it is connected to a stochastic system in imaginary time. This relationship between stochastic systems and quantum systems sheds much light onÂ [supersymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry).
- Experiments and applications[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_superposition&action=edit&section=7)]
	- Successful experiments involving superpositions ofÂ [relatively large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoscopic)Â (by the standards of quantum physics) objects have been performed.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-5)
		- A "[cat state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_state)" has been achieved withÂ [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-6)
		- AÂ [beryllium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium)Â [ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion)Â has been trapped in a superposed state.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-7)
		- AÂ [double slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_slit_experiment)Â has been performed with molecules as large asÂ [buckyballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminsterfullerene)Â and functionalized oligoporphyrins with up to 2000 atoms.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-9)
		- A 2013 experiment superposed molecules containing 15,000 each of protons, neutrons and electrons. The molecules were of compounds selected for their good thermal stability, and were evaporated into a beam at a temperature of 600Â K. The beam was prepared from highly purified chemical substances, but still contained a mixture of different molecular species. Each species of molecule interfered only with itself, as verified by mass spectrometry.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-10)
		- An experiment involving aÂ [superconducting quantum interference device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_quantum_interference_device)Â ("SQUID") has been linked to the theme of the "cat state" thought experiment.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-11)
	- By use of very low temperatures, very fine experimental arrangements were made to protect in near isolation and preserve the coherence of intermediate states, for a duration of time, between preparation and detection, of SQUID currents. Such a SQUID current is a coherent physical assembly of perhaps billions of electrons. Because of its coherence, such an assembly may be regarded as exhibiting "collective states" of a macroscopic quantal entity. For the principle of superposition, after it is prepared but before it is detected, it may be regarded as exhibiting an intermediate state. It is not a single-particle state such as is often considered in discussions of interference, for example by Dirac in his famous dictum stated above.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-Dirac_9-12)Â Moreover, though the 'intermediate' state may be loosely regarded as such, it has not been produced as an output of a secondary quantum analyser that was fed a pure state from a primary analyser, and so this is not an example of superposition as strictly and narrowly defined.Nevertheless, after preparation, but before measurement, such a SQUID state may be regarded in a manner of speaking as a "pure" state that is a superposition of a clockwise and an anti-clockwise current state. In a SQUID, collective electron states can be physically prepared in near isolation, at very low temperatures, so as to result in protected coherent intermediate states. What is remarkable here is that there are two well-separated self-coherent collective states that exhibit suchÂ [metastability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability). The crowd of electrons tunnels back and forth between the clockwise and the anti-clockwise states, as opposed to forming a single intermediate state in which there is no definite collective sense of current flow.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-14)
		- An experiment involving aÂ [flu virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_virus)Â has been proposed.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-15)
		- AÂ [piezoelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectric)Â "[tuning fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuning_fork)" has been constructed, which can be placed into a superposition of vibrating and non-vibrating states. The resonator comprises about 10 trillion atoms.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-16)
		- Recent research indicates thatÂ [chlorophyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll)Â withinÂ [plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants)Â appears to exploit the feature of quantum superposition to achieve greater efficiency in transporting energy, allowing pigment proteins to be spaced further apart than would otherwise be possible.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-doi:10.1038/nature08811-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-18)
		- An experiment has been proposed, with aÂ [bacterial cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterium)Â cooled to 10Â mK, using an electromechanical oscillator.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-19)Â At that temperature, all metabolism would be stopped, and the cell might behave virtually as a definite chemical species. For detection of interference, it would be necessary that the cells be supplied in large numbers as pure samples of identical and detectably recognizable virtual chemical species. It is not known whether this requirement can be met by bacterial cells. They would be in a state of suspended animation during the experiment.
	- InÂ [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing)Â the phrase "cat state" often refers to theÂ [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-20)Â the special entangled state ofÂ [qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit)Â wherein the qubits are in an equal superposition of all being 0 and all being 1; i.e.,
	- {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}{\bigg (}|00\ldots 0\rangle +|11\ldots 1\rangle {\bigg )}.}![|\psi \rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}{\bigg %28}|00\ldots 0\rangle +|11\ldots 1\rangle {\bigg %29}.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/26aac0fa72a1f19180f6d2914259cadd8f07be74)
- Formal interpretation[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_superposition&action=edit&section=8)]
	- Applying theÂ [superposition principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle)Â to a quantum mechanical particle, the configurations of the particle are all positions, so the superpositions make a complex wave in space. The coefficients of the linear superposition are a wave which describes the particle as best as is possible, and whose amplitudeÂ [interferes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_%28wave_propagation%29)Â according to theÂ [Huygens principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens_principle).
	- For any physical property inÂ [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics), there is a list of all the states where that property has some value. These states are necessarily perpendicular to each other using the Euclidean notion of perpendicularity which comes from sums-of-squares length, except that they also must not be i multiples of each other. This list of perpendicular states has an associated value which is the value of the physical property. The superposition principle guarantees that any state can be written as a combination of states of this form with complex coefficients.[__[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)__]
	- Write each state with the value q of the physical quantity as a vector in some basisÂ {\displaystyle \psi _{n}^{q}}![\psi^q_n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f33c33b27a7c25b41e07cf2ccefd27c4e43906f4), a list of numbers at each value of n for the vector which has value q for the physical quantity. Now form the outer product of the vectors by multiplying all the vector components and add them with coefficients to make the matrix
	- {\displaystyle A_{nm}=\sum _{q}q\psi _{n}^{*q}\psi _{m}^{q}}![
	  A_{nm} = \sum_q q \psi^{*q}_n \psi^q_m
	  ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5252515a12b16db59464da837fb16c870100c10)
	- where the sum extends over all possible values of q. This matrix is necessarily symmetric because it is formed from the orthogonal states, and has eigenvalues q. The matrix A is called the observable associated to the physical quantity. It has the property that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors determine the physical quantity and the states which have definite values for this quantity.
	- Every physical quantity has aÂ [Hermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_operator)Â [linear operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator)Â associated to it, and the states where the value of this physical quantity is definite are theÂ [eigenstates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenstate)Â of this linear operator. The linear combination of two or more eigenstates results in quantum superposition of two or more values of the quantity. If the quantity is measured, the value of the physical quantity will be random, with a probability equal to the square of the coefficient of the superposition in the linear combination. Immediately after the measurement, the state will be given by the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue.
- Physical interpretation[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_superposition&action=edit&section=9)]
	- It is natural to ask why ordinary everyday objects and events do not seem to display quantum mechanical features such as superposition. Indeed, this is sometimes regarded as "mysterious", for instance by Richard Feynman.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition#cite_note-21)Â In 1935,Â [Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger)Â devised a well-known thought experiment, now known asÂ [SchrÃ¶dinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat), which highlighted this dissonance between quantum mechanics and classical physics. One modern view is that this mystery is explained byÂ [quantum decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence).[__[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)__]Â A macroscopic system (such as a cat) may evolve over time into a superposition of classically distinct quantum states (such as "alive" and "dead"). The mechanism that achieves this is a subject of significant research, one mechanism suggests that the state of the cat is entangled with the state of its environment (for instance, the molecules in the atmosphere surrounding it), when averaged over the possible quantum states of the environment (a physically reasonable procedure unless the quantum state of the environment can be controlled or measured precisely) the resultingÂ [mixed quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix)Â for the cat is very close to a classical probabilistic state where the cat has some definite probability to be dead or alive, just as a classical observer would expect in this situation. Another proposed class of theories is that the fundamental time evolution equation is incomplete, and requires the addition of some type of fundamentalÂ [Lindbladian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbladian), the reason for this addition and the form of the additional term varies from theory to theory. A popular theory isÂ [Continuous spontaneous localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-collapse_theory), where the lindblad term is proportional to the spatial separation of the states, this too results in a quasi-classical probabilistic state.
