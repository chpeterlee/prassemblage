The [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/5 - Organizations/Entities/We Have a Transnational Dream]] should be my goodbye to critical/political art and also should have enough kick to break art markets + unbalanced markets.

What ChatGPT is great at:

1. Totally banal bullshit that makes up 99% of daily society - hence it's great for just automating boring stupid normie idiot sh-t and walking away!

What ChatGPT not great at:

1. Complex, structured, accurate, novel thought - because it just regurgitated stupid normie sh-t - but once you parameterize, AI can help do all the boring fill-in details, just like normies!
