## Blackhat - question drives Antifragile Agent P. Roxy to find his ethical future self.

1. [[Elan Semiotechne]] - ethical future Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, appears in media. Committing accuratecides with potential kinetic reality bullets,[[0-Personal/Antifragile Peter Lee Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]reality technologies and statistical architecture. Behind a 5th Generation revolution.  Twin Peaks horror vibes.
2. Superpositionally framing Antifragile Agent P. Roxy. Using him to plant seeds in the present through art and [[Adjacent Possibilities]]. There is a parallel murder - the Murder of Thought, with 7 bullets. 
3. Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is trying to clear his name - asking a series of questions. Asks anyone and everyone. Least Stupid Squad at PostworkTV.art . Forced to run for president by [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Characters/Estamasia]]. Play [[Postworkcraft]] in exchange for info. Bet the devil.  Metaphysequalizer tasks. Antifragile training. 1000 deaths in Problem Space. The trick is to die self-aware as a projection of itself.
5. There's other genres mixed in - the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] horror, [[Regener888 (Main)]], etc. Trees Writing Books. PhD. Cross fictions.
6. Uncovers a 5th Generation resistance movement and infrastructure. The Lightslingers. Sculpt, prune, shoot and edit the lumacological gardens. Live in the ivory tower. Their tech and ethics are ancient and antiquated. Some are forced to mine light with blinders.
7. Mother Amasia giving birth to a country the size of the universe through the mouth, which is a statistical architecture a holoiridescent serpentine knot.  What are we looking for - antifragile love. People travel on it, looking for the center.
8. Uncovers the Grey Wars dementropire. Visceral killing of the 1%. Hitman, [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Ideapplebees]], local bar, [[Intercity Planetary]]. [[Elan Semiotechne]] was contracted by a Greywalker. 
9. Council of Conciliance. Argue his case. Conceptual casino.  Return of the dead ideas - the [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Dragon Kings]]. Restore metaphysequality - use proportional response tactics.
10. Postwork Party, Church, craft.

In **[[Fragilicide.live]]**, the Steganographic DocumentaryAntifragile Agent P. Roxy navigates the underground 5th Generation resistance movement - also known as the [[Intercity Planetary]], the future decolonial capital of Amasia.

He is ambushed by chemically imbalanced feminist werewolves blindly cannibalizing their pack at random, must talk fragile vampires down from self-imprisonment and inevitable suicide in the prisons of their own reified psyches, and bring light to the entropy mines of the educational system, staffed by undead teachers, students, and workers, exhausted, near-dead angels who consign 70% of their students to death by neoliberalism and the street.

[[Elan Semiotechne]] could be anyone.  He takes people's faces and data-bodies or avatars and inferences them.

Death itself is a 




Ah, educators are messengers and interpreters, not creators.






Excerpt from **[[Fragilicide.live]]** script:

[[Elan Semiotechne]]: Death itself, when thought in the mind of a living being, is simply a double-sided projection.

On one side, we are faced with the mute fact of corpses as physical mass; on the other side we are faced with the incapacity of the word and thought of death itself.

As this occurs, we experience an obvious separation between our stream of cognitively graspabl
