**The Realist Subplot**

***The Realist Subplot***
Peter wagers that if an artist or non-artist can't do basic math, they will be a psychopath when it comes to dealing with more variables than their own body and mind, beyond the line-of-sight.

1. Tik Tok - bestideas.lol dance party DJ (LMFAO)
2. Shoots ghostlinearities and zombinaries with Bestideas.lol and blocks them with Non-binary shield.
3. Calls upon the help of the witches and Estamasia to open the portal to Neoliberal Hell and exorcise the AI demon lord, Loab.


----

Fragility isn't The Real, but fragilities are real; Non-binary Love is the Real, for real yo.

- Captain Amasia

----





***The Realist Subplot***

To stop Loab the 1st and 2nd Generation AI demon lord of fragility with a wager on love, **Non-binary Korean Chongha Peter Lee Performing as Captain Amasia** must journey to the deepest circles of Neoliberal Hell, who's entry portal is located in the identity politics art scene.














1. Underground signals - witches
2. Movie and etc.  (Captain Amasia; Amasian Peoples; dreaminess and mom.)
3. Above ground signals - least Inaccurate (falsehood and quantity)- Triptych and bet that Love is the Real.
4. Hyperobject painting and Sculptures of learning; cool school and cosmopolitical protests.
5. Have 3 splits and 3 pairs, like DNA.















A Planetary Forward Escape in 2023

1. **CUT THE FAT:** If we boil down the art pipeline to: Public, Press and Planet - a small technoculturally-savvy avant garde can easily outmaneuver the 80's specialist academia, the 90's networked self-policing, the 00's fly-by-night startup economy, the 10's clickbait journalism and the 20's illiterate entropy.
2. **SAVE THE FUTURE:** The aim is not to engage in and transform these existing structures; it is to organize a planetary forward escape away from them, reassemblaging resources for the energy required.
3. **THERE WILL BE BLOOD:** Many are going to die from neoliberalism and fragility in the coming decades; traditional teaching and organizing is out of the question because so few have literacy. The only option is to function on the level of dream, subperception and loopholes. 80% automation, 20% interaction. Expect 99% failure rates from humans.
















***The Realist Subplot***

The fragile should be in therapy.

Social practice should be left to skilled professionals, organizers and educators.

Critique and justice should be left to those with the intellectual and technological imagination.












Seriously; in the 21st Century, where there are trained professionals who can provide safe environments for fragile individuals - it's absolutely disgusting to drive them and push them to self implosion.






***The Realist Subplot***

Peter paints the "Least Neoliberal Identity Politics Model Triptych: Change My Mind".

(Statistically verifiable argument being that neoliberal identity politics is traumatizing the oppressed, culture and art simultaneously.

This doesn't require an erasure of identity, as in the stupidity of Modernism, but simply the reduction of neoliberal influences, modes and impacts in identity construction; it doesn't even ask for the adoption of positive modes, although it highly suggests s.)

1. Change My Mind
2. Cute Stuff

5. It's ridiculous to not do this.












## Least Inaccurate Identity Politics Triptych
1. Proof there is accurate and inaccurate. Proof there's quantity involved in relation to physical bodies
2. Religious Belief
3. Co-op shares rather than the stupidity of boom/bust individuals. Cite Oscar Murilllo.







## Neuroscience: dissipation and reformation of neurons.

3. Peter paints the "Accurately Valued Non-Binary Art Triptych", in which he paints the inferences, theory and proofs that comprise accurate identity politics - which the viewer can adopt by simply learning the inferences painted - hence effectively neutralizing inaccuracies in Identity politics itself who's primary mechanism is comprised of distributed inferential mechanisms.
4. The "Accurate Identity Politics Triptych", is simply based on accurate inferencing of various parameters, constantly transforming in time towards Least Stupidity.
5. There's a last conceptual and formal twist, which is the secret sauce, but of course it can only be revealed later.

Peter appropriates the polymaths of the planet, calls it the **"Hyperobject Sculptural Assemblage of the Least Stupid People on the Planet That Actually Have the Skills and Literacies to Solve Today's Ecosocial Problems".**


Peter constructs an accurate Gen 1 and Gen 2 identity politics art market which also reconciles the formalist art market, makes money off of the consulting and computation and then leaves them both.

On to Phase 3.


***The Realist Subplot***

1. Peter paints the constraints of an "Artificial Identity", which raises the obvious question of - if clearly there ARE artificial identities (for example if Peter claimed he was a squirrel, he could prove by multiple tests that he was not)- what are "real identities"?
2. Of course to be a verifiably

***The Realist Subplot***

An epic World War film (because both boomers and Gen X perceive through this cultural paradigm), which follows the near future, past and adjacent possible events of **"World War 0"** - a War defined by 3 parameters:

1. Today's systems are physically and logistically so fragile, so staffed by undereducated individuals from top to bottom, that there's a huge chance of some random circuit misfiring in some weather change or errant electromagnetic pulse and setting off a massive infrastructural catastrophe.
2. The past World Wars were precipitated by massive socioeconomic inequities, particularly distribution of technocultural literacies and skills of accurate arbitration, and hence their core mechanisms can be adequately defined as "inaccurate stupidity" (to be differentiated from "accurate stupidity", useful in the arts and sciences) - which is obviously the real pandemic affecting the planet today.
3.









***The Realist Subplot***

Identity politics is 3 problems:

1. Knowledge management.
2. Accurate market valuation.
3. Labor sourcing.

The Emergent Centers makes a dual-channel VR film of the phygital effects of World War 2 on the 2nd World called "2nd World War World ND2".


























***The Realist Subplot***

1. **Problem for most regions:** every possible solution exists but very few can coordinate the parts to implement solutions ethically and sustainably. 99% of the time if you hand out a new tool without instruction, people just boom and bust it.
2. **Problem in knowledge, art and culture:** the technocultural equivalent to the IPhone 16 exists, but only like 10 people on Earth can use it; 99% of art is using the IPhone 1, and they can't tell the difference between IPhone 1 and 16, and neither do they even know that the IPhone 1 is something just evolved over time by a bunch of random weirdos doing random weird things - hence either it's taken super seriously or it's taken for granted.
3. There is no coherent, fair market for it, neither is there a culture of self-awareness, respect and accurate exchange to nurture it.

























***The Realist Subplot***

Captain Amasia is a 2nd World superhero with 3 superpowers:

1. They are one of the 100 or less non-binary and non-linear individuals alive with the skills to coordinate regional self-organizing.
2. They are one of the 10 individuals alive who know how to use the equivalent of the Iphone 16 of art, science and philosophy; 99% of the planet is stuck on Iphone 1.
3. They have a balanced diet, fitness program, and have a massive archive of critical, complex and playful evolutionary organs that puts the endless output of mediocre stupidity today to shame.

No more! Work straight with the talented youth.

***The Realist Subplot***

Regionalist efforts can directly challenge and destroy the stupidity of overblown and inaccurate international theory and art, both in institutions and markets.

***The Realist Subplot***

*Go West, Antifragile Artists; Fragile Artists, Go East*

Peter leaves the Gen 1, 2 and 3, 1980's-2000's economy of the East Coast and moves to the West Coast where they have a fully developed economy for Gen 4 and Gen 5 2010-2020 media and invention.

4. Slowly, Peter escapes the triple threat cultural catastrophe and deadlock of Boomer/Gen X/Millenial culture.
5. He makes objectively valued polymath art, film, games, hustles and activism with Gen Z and Gen Alpha which balance regional ecosocial systems.

2. **Peter builds an AI to automate interactions with millenials, Gen X and boomers. He spends 90% of his time with Gen Z and Gen Alpha making insane ass-kicking polymath art, film and games.















The Realist Subplot:

Consult on therapy and basic services for the fragile; build solutions with the antifragile.

(Clearly, humans need 3rd party verification and guidance.)

***The Realist subplot***

So it appears that most large organizations staff the fragile conservatives (80%) and fragile progressives (20%).

Neither actually have the skills and literacies for autonomy, invention, and collaboration which then predictably begets the repetitive conflict and boom/bust cycles.

The Realist Subplot

There are two institutional types that should not be in institutions:

1. Fascist nepotistic idiots with objectively low intellectual and technical skill making minor contributions or variations to conservative ideas. **They should be in therapy in low-stimulus work.**
2. Fragile individuals who have zero intellectual or technical skill and are attempting to stabilize their sense of self. **They should be in therapy and in low-stimulus work.**

The Realist wagers against the stupidity of fragility in both full capitalism and full communism:

1. Humans have to eat and also organize information.
2. All modern systems are constantly at risk of breaking and killing everyone.
3. The more fragile individuals or organizations are, the more likely they will die.
4. In both full capitalism and communism, you only have a few skilled people who have to support both the rich and the poor; if the few skilled people on Earth die, the infrastructure breaks and most of the world dies.
5. Even in full communism, taxation from people's labor flows towards institutions and systems aimed at coordinating positive collective outcomes for regions. Thus institutional personnel are beholden to their regional contributions and the larger evolutionary trajectory of the planet.

2. **Earn some pocket money for parties and dates!** Earn commission for selling and performing balanced culture, tools and systems!

















***The Realist Subplot***

99%, we have people with:

1. Good network, crap skills and high risk of suicide.
2. Crap network, high skills and gives zero f-cks about ethics.

Very few people with:

- Good network, good skills and ethics.

#### The Realist subplot

**An appropriate dual strategy for the fragile and the specialists:**

Fragile:
Toys, play, parties, poetry, sales games.
(Don't ask to build or systematize. Expect Zombinaries).

Specialists:
Stories, murals, exhibition, film, hackathon games.
(Don't ask to synthesize or collaborate. Expect GhostLinearities).














***The Realist Subplot***

Rule 0:

The fragile are not going to learn skills; if they could, they would. They can only network, sell and earn on commission.

Never teach them. It takes an ungodly amount of time and never develops.

Specialists can only produce what they know. Never ask them to invent. Their best usage is for error-checking and providing legitimacy as an audience.

Never produce with specialists. There is no flexibility.













Fragile networkers and sales; specialist error-checkers and CVs.

Done with the institutions and biennales and blah blah.
















"Unimaginable portrait no. 33: a scene without the pressures of capital destroying the fragile and forcing specialists into constant mediocre production" 2023




The stupidity of politics and art today:

1. There are 6.85 smart phones; maybe another 25 billion addressable devices and bots.
2. You have to understand how supremely stupid approaches to digital media and technology are by humans, even those who are paid as professionals to work with them or study them.
3. Clearly, being able to craft this stuff is a skill, like writing. If you can write, you have options that you don't have if you can't write.
4. Dude, we live in the wake of neoliberalism. The majority is not going to go out and teach themselves skills, either technologically or socially, and definitely not both.

## *The Realist Subplot*

Why is universal formalism in art as objectively inaccurate of a planetary evolutionary strategy as the identity politics art paradigm?

1. Formalist art exists in the larger context of planetary evolution; it does not supercede it. Additionally, human identity exists in the larger context of planetary evolution, it does not supercede it.
2. We can easily prove this by proving that the planet evolved before the discourse of art or identity politics did.
3. The stupidity of attempting to produce a universal formal grammar or a universal ontology of identity can be proven by simply demonstrating how invisible light, such as X-rays, operate outside of the visible range of human vision which a universal formal grammar would interface with, and how much energy it costs to transform human socio-informational systems.
4.









What is an accurate definition of a 'generation', or in a larger context, 'peoples' ?

1. A generation or peoples is comprised of semiotechnical feedback systems that operate in the context of the planet's evolutionary architecture.
2. Hence the difference in generations can simply be measured by their flexibility to self-balance across diverse planetary evolutionary ecosystems, spatial scales and periodicities.
3. In the context of planetary evolutionary architecture, you can compare semiotechnical feedback systems and their capacities to complexify sustainably and ethically.
4. You can easily objectively prove that









***The Realist Subplot***

An accurate assessment of millenial strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats:

1. Millenials are much more skilled and balanced as a whole than prior generations or younger generations. They are also the sociopolitical majority of the planet.
2. On the tail end of techno-neoliberalism, this generation has a massively depleted historical and generalist memory in relation to Boomers and Gen X, but much more rapid adoption with specialist skills, subcultures and technological platforms. While suffering from psychosocial issues and trauma reducing their work rate, it is not as crippling as in Gen Z and younger.
3. The opportunities are almost boundless, if proper interoperability protocols can be constructed between Gen Y. Every material, cognitive and cultural asset exists within this single generation, and simply needs to he coordinated.
4. There are 3 threats arising internally, externally and from in-between. There is the threat of psychosocial trauma caused by constraints from older and younger generations of society suffocating new millenial-native possibilities; there is the threat of outdated psychological constructions destroying the millenial's self-organizing capacities; there is the threat of unexamined binaries fragmenting millenial solidarity and goals and linear logics producing inaccurate calculations of the past, present and adjacent possible.

The Realist Subplot:

In the film, an alien attack has infantilized THE ENTIRE PLANET'S visual arts ecology into identity politics; additionally, it has thrown media art back into the Stone Age, centering around endlessly boring video essays alluding to political poetics, with zero attempt to produce imaginative solutions.

As a result, Peter Lee launches a new ongoing performance titled:

### What is the art market and what is art in the academy? Where is actual new stuff made?

1. The art market is literally a market. You make something that looks super polished, throw in identity  and then you make up a 1 sentence story so that a gallerist can understand it enough to say it to some rich dude who buys stuff based on what they ate for lunch, their asset portfolio or their living room.
2. Art in the academy is a club minus the drugs. Replace taste in music with whatever thing someone identifies with. Add in technophobia, social phobias and total administrative disorganization, and voila, you have art in the academy.
3. Where actual new stuff happens, as always, is in independent financing, production and audience-building by pranking the stupidity of cultural inertia.

3. 99% has some cultural or technological skills but not enough for self-organizing. 99% of problems are simply from not being able to coordinate existing parts. Gen Z, with proper direction actually have the most potential for progressive self-organization.
4. A string of statistically accurate but visually surreal artworks, films and games are made about possible ways to interconnect and then actually solve today's problems.

Wager: 99% of current Humanities and Sciences infrastructures have no capacity to produce new inclusively scalable adaptations to address today's ecosocial crises, hence they will be complicit in large amounts of preventable death, unless they radically shift focus on to a few [[polymath]]s who are already doing 80% of the significant work in the Humanities and Sciences.

2. U.S. artists to EU / prank the U.S.










**Let's walk through the U.S. art scene:**

1. 65% of U.S. 4th graders can't read competently; only about 30% or less of U.S. individuals have higher education. A huge chunk of this is insane individuals with inherited money or fragile individuals who should be in therapy pushed through an educational sausage factory. (Kids, if you want real education, go to Germany). So people addressable by art is a fraction of 30%. People who fund it is a fraction of this fraction.
2. 60% of U.S. art is for identity politics painting; 30% is for identity politics sculpture.
3. This means clearly, some type of spontaneous social self-organization sparked from an intellectual movement is HIGHLY unlikely in the U.S., particularly when you factor in the low likelihood of people not making money from either.
4. There's a crapton of media art/research artists in the U.S.; there's extremely little funding for it.
5. The low literacy and higher education rate explains the lower cultural and technological literacy in the U.S.  It also explains why its institutions, industries and governmental organizations are always going to be inflexible and inadequate. If you want anything actually done well, best to learn how to do it yourself; also the only strategy in this utterly stupid environs is pranks!

"10 Antinomies of Neganthropic Modernism Carved in Neganthropo.site" a 5th Generation Hyperobject Sculpture and Ongoing Performance by Chongha Peter Lee, Jon Perez and Ozan Atalan and Various AI of the Emergent Centers

1. Reality as a mix of BOTH mind dependent and independent mechanisms. All systems tend towards negentropy, or neganthropy over time.  Love-in-itself comprises the register of the Real, not the Symbolic. All of the continents are drifting towards a Neo-Pangean supercontinent named Amasia. All possible inferences can be wagered upon and statistically verified.
2. Not all things must be defined as a problem; but all things could circumstantially be defined as a problem. For every circumstantially defined problem, a solution can be inferred and verified, either within or outside of an artwork. All problems and solutions are bounded in spatial scale and temporal periodicity.
3. All components of all problems and solutions can be broken into assemblage feedback systems of physical and/or informational inferences.
4. Every organizational entity or individual entity can be described as an input and output inferential feedback system, which can then be parsed into inferential functions of varying scale and periodicities. Each function can be parsed into minimum inferential units.
5. Every organization, individual, feedback system, function and inference as a whole or in parts can be statistically proven and reviewed to be entropic or negentropic within a defined feedback system ecology. An exchange value can be more or less accurately assigned accordingly.
6. Both human and non-human agents can infer the statistical claims, proofs and verifications for every inference, in varying degrees of accuracy and inferential distance.
7. The accuracy of any given inference can be qualified through the idea of "inferential distance" in which a claim is measured against its statistical consistency.
8. A frequently used method for presenting high accuracy inferences is to construct "explanatory interlocks" of inferences, a form of multi-media evidentiary presentation used in courts.
9. Inferences do not have to have occurred yet to be statistically evaluated; simulations and various logical proofs can statistically proof speculative elements of an inference prior to its actualization in an event.
10. All inferences have a minimum physical existence as a kinetic potential energy system which costs more or less energy to actualize.

**The Realist's answer to the 2 extremist positions of purely deterministic reality and purely subjective reality (this is relevant to regional autonomy, particularly when we are disputing the governance of social systems or ecological systems):**

1. **If reality was a purely deterministic clockwork** - there would not be such a thing as inaccurate judgements and statements. However, inaccurate judgements are clearly abundant by humans and non-humans, and hence we can say that there are elements of reality which are affected by subjective perspectives constructing both accurate and inaccurate judgements, case-by-case.
2. **If reality was purely a subjective or social construction,** there would be no such thing as your heart beating subconsciously, independent of your thought; it would require a subject or society to constantly make it beat. The fact that we have heart attacks or don't have to spend our attention just making our heart beat means that there are systems that work outside of our consciousness.
3. **Clearly, reality is a mix of BOTH subjective thought causing effects and systems beyond the control of subjective thought.** Because of this, we use multiple instruments and methodologies to corral the accuracy or inaccuracy of particular claims or understandings of systems. Everything is useful in relation  to one problem or another, and we can also rate what is more appropriate for X problem vs. Y problem (like forks are more appropriate for eating salads than soup.)
4. In terms of balancing the various ecosocial dynamics of our regions across the planet - the more accurate we can be in a more diverse range of cases, the quicker and more effective we will save lives, find real love and make less boring art.
5. We can wager on this!

### "Sufficient Realism", 2023

Today, we have every tool necessary to solve every ecosocial conflict on the planet, even going 500 million years into the future.

We don't have the tools necessary to agree on solutions for the entire universe.

Also note; most of today's scientists, artists and engineers aren't inventors - they are information workers. Invention is typicallly a byproduct for them, not a skillset.

## Upcoming: AccuratelyValued.Art

An artwork generating AI and data-backed evaluations of accurate valuations of both art and non-art transactions and a data and digital expropriation co-op redistributing the proceeds to vulnerable populations.

(Objectively, accurate valuations are possible if inaccurate valuations exist.

Additionally, if the majority of art and non-art transactions are inaccurately valued at this time, this makes accurate valuation a rare and unique artwork and product.)















# LeastStupid.Art

1. 80% of art market value is based on some random physical object or a brand.
2. However, obviously to claim some type of non-exchange based value, people usually sprinkle in some idea of ecology or society or tech or poetry.
3. The small minority that deal with concepts in earnest are usually holed up in academies and have no interest or skill in broader engagement.
4. Okay, so to bring balance to the situation, all we have to do is produce a negative valuation mechanism and a positive valuation mechanism.
5. Thankfully, the academics and scientists are isolated enough to be able to launch critiques at the market; but they have no skills to implement any type of change or even stabilize themselves.
6. So what we can do is posit that a fraction of the markets do desire some type of value beyond physicality and brand; it is easy to accurately establish this value; it is also easy to adjust the value of existing artworks and participants based on this, both legally and extralegally.
7. Hmm, so this question of conceptual, cultural and planetary value can just be brought to the forefront through an artwork itself - which would be the Least Stupid Art, obviously.

In the U.S. and Western EU, 90% of art functions as alternate therapy, not in art as a productive, critical field. These are 2 different games and aims that can coexist if the differences are understood. (Like how people with different allergies can eat at the same restaurant without demanding the other to be slaughtered!)

So **proposal**: alternative therapy art people - do alternative therapy art. Don't do infrastructural art and vice versa! (Like peanut allergy people, don't eat peanuts, soy allergy people, don't eat soy). Resource allocation should accurately reflect what would most effectively create positive outcomes for a region's children first, insane grown adult children second.

Wager: the future of art is in creating a more clean, efficient restaurant that can service more diverse diets and allergies - NOT burning down the walls and divisions and mixing the poop with the potatoes (but you do you, dude!).















Why waste energy destroying these different games? However, I should say, we should keep the people who need therapy away from complex infrastructural issues. They could possibly contribute something significant, as anything including a microbe could - but the odds are low in comparison to a trained infrastructuralist.

They could function in safe simulation spaces, but you would have to expend energy curating and cleaning it to keep it from causing distress, which would then draw resources. This could also be fine if they shouldered the labor burden - again as long as it doesn't cause them to imbalance and then draw more resources!

## Why is art and theory (and culture/knowledge production in general) so stagnant today? The economics, bro.

1. Art is 80% trying to live in a freelance ecology that has zero pay and zero self-organizational skills
2. Theory is the same

Hence, 80% of people's energy is going towards trying to get a piece of shrinking pie. Artists go for art money, theory goes for theory money - both are beholden to the social norms of individuals who are 80% hostage to their sources of revenue and spend 80% of their time on therapy.

Say there is a crazy fuck like Chongha Peter Lee who has gone rogue and is both a skilled independent artist AND skilled independent theorist - then said individual can make paradigm shifts in 1 month that it would take others 10 years.

What to do? Obviously, I would highly suggest non-independent individuals to gain the skills to become independent AND THEN rapidly produce paradigm shifts - but this is so counter to everything the individual has been taught, there's an incredibly low likelihood of success without guidance - or automation lol.

Bottom line, I'd say go figure out how to be independent and also help others, participate EXTREMELY lightly in paradigm shifts, then return to making stuff ... but again, from my experience, only about 20% will go this way!
