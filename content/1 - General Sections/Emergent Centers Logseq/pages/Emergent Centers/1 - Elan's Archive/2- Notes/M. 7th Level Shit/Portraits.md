There Are Also Probably Many Other Intellectually Badass Leaders and Figures That I Personally Have Yet to Learn Of."

### "Dear God, we are in for a long, boring time of lots of dumb culture propagated by people who don't know better, and people dying of stupid, preventable sh-t. Might as well make some movies, mocking the former and stopping the latter!" 2023










Due to the fact that the Earth will self-correct over time, it is of the greatest necessary to divorce art from both concepts and labor, and simply refocus it on play and beauty.

Leave the thinking to the [[polymath]]s and the AI! Humans suck at it, don't expect it from them, really ain't their strong suit.








Really, the best use of AI today would be making humans comfortable with dying.







Why the f--k are all these people so uptight about dying? What the f--k else do people think about? 

Can you imagine living an entire human life and not knowing what the Hell a human is and being scared of death? What a waste of time lol.
