5th Generation Revolution:

1.  The 1% are responsible for 70% of the ecological damage, 100% of social inequity.
2. The state should be the intermediary regulating and distributing resources from the 1%. We are not supposed to have individuals acquiring aid and public services from individuals.
3. The state is underskillled at this time; it would be best to simply just contract the functions.
4. There are simple metrics to sort the contractors.
5. Some implementations will lead to more or less dead and more or less catastrophes at this time. Choose well!

Advice on neurodivergent populations in art:

1. Don't teach them critical theory; critical theory is comprised of logics and paradigms which will not be interpreted accurately and simply make the neurodivergent miserable.
2. They are great at aesthetic perception- turn them towards pure formalism, and the keeping of archives. 
3. For any organizational collective logics, have them sign a contract deferring to an AI via proxy.

What do you do with the neurodivergent?
1. Throw out expectations of society and critical theory. These requires logic. Without interpretive skills, it will just make them miserable.
2. Aim them at formalist art and archival work. 
3. Why? Because they are fundamentally just biomechanical machines producing evolutionary variance, driven 99% by sensory stimulation. Let them be happy!
4. Have an AI handle all their logistics.
5. Have it paid for by the state contracting skilled groups.

"[[Postworkcraft]] Minigame for Most Artists:

You're most likely a formalist, not a conceptualist.

1. Forget critical theory, stop watching the news.
2. Go find and collect weird and beautiful stuff.
3. Don't try to justify it conceptually, don't kill anything in the process
4. If you don't have fun, you lose"
