# Least Stupidity

Least stupidity is composed of 3 axioms:

1. Least stupidity is not the absence of stupidity (or to put it in quantifiable terms - entropy within a system); it is the minimization of entropy within a system and maximization of inclusive scalability.
2. As all systems (or perspectives) are limited in their capacity to compute the universe - there will always be differences in information between systems (or perspectives). As systems and perspectives exchange information, they can mutually reduce the entropy with each other and increase their capacities for inclusive scalability.
3. As additional information is presented the constraints of what the "least stupid" system state is changes, as does optimal pathways to inclusive scalability.

Why use the colloquial term "stupid"? Currently most societies have general populations who are 70% operating at high school level, and a 29.9% professional population who are operating at a high school level with a few specialized skills.

Speaking of entropy, or more technical terms, would exclude discussion with the Postwork Majority; this would not result in least stupidity and maximal inclusive scalability.
