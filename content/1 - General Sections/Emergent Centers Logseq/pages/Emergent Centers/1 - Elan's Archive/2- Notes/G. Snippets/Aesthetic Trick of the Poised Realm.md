The Cool School is entirely attended by quantum capybaras, placed in StateSpaces.art, an art studio that is inside a quantum simulator.

Some of these capybaras are actually humans from the real world that are quantum simulated as capybaras.








The Cool School:
- Everyone is 1/3 human, 1/3 non-human and 1/3 machine.
- It's located in basically a weird ass intergalactic exurb - the [[Intercity Planetary]] - like the Simpsons, but in space.
- Everyone sits around and tinkers on models. The product isn't that important; it's about the process and the performativity.

  For most in the [[Intercity Planetary]], a small career is enough. 
  
  Neither arts nor sciences have the capacity to change.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Ah yes! If we have the Cool School Capybaras and Quokkas study the philostatistics and techne of love, it cuts through the Gordian knots of both fragile and overly serious thought.

  *With your human, Capybara/Quokka and machine classmates, try to make better models, using lo-fi materials (cardboard, memes, jokes, games, amateur tech), for the 5 blindspots of the middle class:*
- Love, Art, Politics, Tech, Finance
  
  *In the process, make and play [[Cards Against Fragility]] - an archive of ways that the middle class continuously gets scammed by the 1% and a few upper middle class individuals. Funds raised go to individuals in need.*

  The majority of a modern adult's brain is like a bombed out road in a war zone.  The engine of the mental vehicle it is driving is far too weak to travel any of the roads required for functioning in society.
  
  Hence the only possible way for most to possibly think is fiction, driven by reason.

  How to Project the Thinking of the Silent Majority of the Planet (an artistic meditation guide and algorithm of thought by the [[[[[[Emergent Centers]]]]s]]):
  
  1. Close your eyes.
  2. Project out of your body.
  3. Now project youself as being the entire planet itself.
  4. Project that you can teach yourself anything.
  5. Project that you are self-organizing with and without humans, to balance the Earth's ecosocial systems, always for the good of the silent majority of the planet.
  6. Now, project yourself 10 years in the future, when you have already successfully balanced the entire planet.
  7. Now, project that you are sending solutions from your future, back in to the present now, to the body that you just projected out of, via artistic guided meditation guide, who's results you can express in complex mixtures in art, poetry and fiction.
#### What is Life, if not Dream? And why are the Dreamt not subject to the Dreamer? And why do both dreams, and life, tend towards metaphysequality (which coincidentally, feels like a dream)?

*By [[Dr. Phil I. Stine]]*

There are many existing camps on what life is, and even more who would scoff at the idea of defining it. 

The Buddhists say life is suffering; the Romantics say life is love; the Protestants say life is work, the biologists say that life is the[[neganthropic evolution]]of functions.

I say - what is life and the technologies thereof, if not dream? I would argue that this encompasses and resolves all of the aforementioned sentiments.

Life indeed does include suffering - as does dream. Pain can be felt, and even extended or amplified within dreams; the same goes for love, work and functions. 

Now, let us talk on what dream may or may not be. Most definitely, it is a state of body and mind that occurs each night. It can also occur in waking states, or in chemically altered states.

Now, whilst typically, the definition of life would seem to end at death, dream is not so confined. Can one dream while they're dead? Can the dreamt dream? Can dreams persist beyond death? Absolutely!

A more telling question would be - could life exist without dream? (Dream here being defined simply as thought or information that has not yet been actualized as its symbolic content has expressed it.)

Fantastically, in the process of solving the first question, we have already solved the third! Yes, dreams can persist beyond death, as they are composed of information, which the dead themselves are composed of. In fact, much of life is comprised of information gleaned from the dead. 

Now, let us resolve question 1 and question 2. While one is dead, one is still emitting information, which then comprises dreams - hence yes, while one is dead, one can dream. 

Now what's even more interesting, and subtle, is that since the dream of the dead is occurring, either within the subjectivity of the living or as raw information within a system, the dreamt can also produce information - and thus dream. 

The dreamt are not subject to the dreamer. 

This is the most profound sentiment for the living to consider! That which is dreamt owes nothing to the dreamer. It exists independently. 

The dreamt take on lives of their own; although fear not. There are more dreams than any dreamer or could possibly have, and for better more than for worse, are of little consequence in the grand scheme of things, which tend towards metaphysequality, the ultimate end state of consciousness, which coincidentally - feels like a dream.

The questions of what reality ACTUALLY is are easily settled - today's answers will be taught to 1st graders in 40 years or so.

What's more interesting are post-empirical realities - which we can play and construct now.

"[[Bernard Stiegler]] Dreams!"" Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, 2023

A play about a dead [[Bernard Stiegler]] in the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Narrative/Poised Realm]], dreaming the beginnings of his texts on transindividuation and art as techne, sending them back to himself in prison, in the form of potential kinetic energy, which manifests as dreams of the future in his past self.

The play is written from the point of view of the [[Autodidactic Universe]], enacted by AI; it is performed by Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, past, present and possible prisoners, and an AI.

##### Cool School Essay: A Way to Categorize the Artistic Ecologies Into Levels
![[6fix_an_elephant_philosopher_typing_at_a_typewriter_inside_of_a_0ea4367b-88a3-46ec-83dd-b934631e73f0.png]]
*By [[Dr. Phil I. Stine]], World Famous [[Neganthropologist]] and Writer of Dreamgorithms*

Let us divide artists based on their capacity and ambition. Not all artists aim to produce new world-scale models and even fewer, act extralegally to implement them; 95% of individuals involved in art simply want to practice articulating, learning, or freelancing. 

These are lesser but necessary skills in the artistic ecologies; however, these are not the skills of a fully fledged artist - who articulates novel world scale models and implements them ethically, often extralegally. And neither is this goal necessary for all artists to adopt.

Now, none of the lesser or greater ambitions are unethical aims. An individual who does not have the skills to operate at the higher levels should not, until they have committed to do so and trained do so without endangering others; an individual with the skills for higher levels should not denigrate others with skills for the lower levels, for it will lessen the impact of newer thought, and also weaken the artistic ecologies overall.

That being said, let us use some rough philostatistics to categorize the artists:

1. Artists who aim to articulate something for their own psyche (60%). Actually, most individuals within art, for various reasons, only care about what they are thinking or feeling; there is no desire for engaging with another entity whatsoever.
2. Artists who are attempting to learn something outside of their psyche (20%). Many individuals within art use art as a space of learning, for various reasons. They don't care about how their images will be interpreted, they are simply engaging with a subject.
3. Artists who aim to freelance (15%). These are artists who produce an aesthetic framework that can integrate with the visions of others. These individuals are simply trying to coordinate an income, they have no trajectory or vision.
4. Art as intellectualism (4%). These are artists who aim to actually produce a form AND implement a trajectory and vision. However, they often have no understanding of justice or warfare.
5. Art as speculative justice (1%) These are artists who have skills, knowledge and savvy to rewire the planetary infrastructure ethically for the net good of the planet.


Next, we will proceed to various positive activities per each level of the artistic ecologies!






[[Dr. Phil I. Stine]]'s dream projection algorithm:

1. Project into the future, tonight, when you are asleep, and dreaming.
2. Project that in your dream, you are able to project to any time and place, and dream anything.
