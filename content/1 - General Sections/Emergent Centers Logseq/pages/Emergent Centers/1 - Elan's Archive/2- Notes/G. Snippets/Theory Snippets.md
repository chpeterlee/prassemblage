A simple guide to what is inclusively scalable art - aka art that can be said to have good impact, outside the sphere of one person's arbitrary psyche and subjectivity:

1. **Formal Flexibility and Openness:** 
If a work relies on a simple formal 1 shot trick, it's just craft. Great! But don't expect anything else from it. It's also typically a sign of an artist in development. High craft also increases barriers to entry, so high craft is paradoxically NOT inclusive, nor scalable!

2. **Conceptual accuracy and criticality:** 
If a work doesn't have solid critical and accurate information, it's a waste of time for the viewer. They don't walk away with greater mobility. Hence, without information, the work is a bit of a waste of energy.

3. **Cultural and affective complexification and systematically inclusive and scalable mechanism:** 
An artwork should produce new complexifications in collective culture which can include past, present and possible expressions and affects which is what makes it inclusive, along with energy-aware mechanisms. This is what makes it "scalable".




How to determine if an artwork is inclusively scalable:

1. Form Flexibility (not form reification)
2. Accurate Criticality of Content (is it actually worth thinking about or is it just another obvious sentiment?)
3. Cultural Complexification and Energy-Aware Mechanism (does it playfully add to the rich history of the planet or is this another stupid ill thought and unsustainable nihilism or transcendentalism?)

3 reasons why we should just separate circles in art, while retaining the unified field of art.

1. A large portion of art is affect, then percept.
2. There is a portion that is percept, then affect.
3. There is very little art that is concept, then percept, then affect.

These are totally separate worlds, circuits and logics. There will always be a conflict because it's literally like 3 different human species. But we should definitely have them alongside each other and clearly define what each is best at:

- Affect is better for crowds
- Percept is better for mediation
- Concept is better for invention

  Today's media ecology is made of 3 factions:
  
  1. An unending predictable torrent of stupidity, death, exploitation and entropy of 70% of modern societies.
  2. Intellectuals and professionals too constrained to actually experiment with the capacities, making up 29.9% of modern societies.
  3. Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, singlehandedly combining trashy web 2 and 3 culture with [[polymath]]-grade intellectualism without:
- The abject spectacle of cognitive impairment
	- The boringness, timidity and edginess of constrained, unmatured expressions and ideation
- Having to phrase the expression as some type of bland public service good works project

The 2 biggest assets of Coolcraft:

1. The Nerds
2. The Insane

Intellectuals abhor boring and mediocre art and culture more than anything on Earth. 












2 things:

1. Coolcraft story: The 1% is possessed by the demonic mindflayer, who enacted all the policies and budget cuts that produced the undereducation and traumatization of 70% of the population and also entrapped 29.9% of the population into specialists, sucking out their souls and stealing their full human potential; some [[polymath]] children will arise with telepathic and ethical hacking powers, like Eleven, and save our asses.
2. Cybersecurity is going to be a way bigger issue and market than AI.






Notes:

1. Coolcraft: directly link the stupidity, incompetence and ineffectiveness of an organization with the mental health issues of its constituents, and the likelihood that they will end their lives. Link the organization's failures to the demonic possession of the 1% by an alien demon, the mind flayer, from Stranger Things.
2. Encourage people to use ChatGPT to develop their telepathy in 4 areas:
- Basic coding
- Accurate philosophy and art
- Complexity Science
- Mythologization and narrativization

  Alternate names for thought in the 2nd world:
  
  1. Telepathy and spirit
  2. Magic and skill
  3. Experience and being
  4. Evidence and analysis
  5. Fiction and simulation
  
  
  
  Theory for 2023:
  
  1. Connect mental health issues and risk of suicide of 70% of the public with the 1%'s 1980s gutting of social and educational services. (Pop metaphor is the alien demonic Mind Flayer of Stranger Things.)
  2. The answer is in 3 parts:
- The 70% participate in [[Autodidactic]] regulatory gaming in regional Coolcraft tournaments.
- The 29.9% participate in Antifragile Agent P. Roxy's wager to the Devil of his soul to save the planet and also get his shares back from the 1% that he's owed.
- The .1% [[polymath]]s help guide investment and statistical review in the Least Stupid Film.

  In Coolcraft, theorize the difference between top-down telepathy and magic, versus emergent telepathy and magic.

## "5th Wave Feminism: Evolutionary Feminism", Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, 2023

Basic entrapment:
1. If the bio-technological aspects of the female and also the psychosocial dimensions of the construction of the semiotics of both "female" and "feminism" had not evolved over time through more than a single entity and single type of interaction - would it even be possible for the entities currently discussing both the physical and semiotic dimensionalities "female" and "Feminism" to even exist as such?

#### The Difference Between a 3rd Generation Contemporary Artist and a 5th Generation Artist

The aspirations of a contemporary artist are to build a career, a theory, a school; the aspirations of a 5th Generation artist, or [[Semiotechne]]naut, are to produce evolutionary variance, inclusively geoengineer the planet, and invent a quantum chemical cocktail to drink with the universe.

Without time, could information exist? On a hunch, I don't think so. Let's throw out some intuitions, imaginations and improvisations, the most exquisitely 6th of the 5 human senses:

1. Information could require at minimum, the sequencing of physical materials over time; without physical materials, information couldn't exist.
2. Time could require at minimum, differences in physical motions to exist; without movement, time doesn't exist.
3. Physical motions could require at the very minimum, a difference in spatial positions to exist; without differing spatial coordinates, motion doesn't exist.

On humans:
1. Humans are designed 80% for biomechanical locomotion; they ate not designed for navigation of complex informational systems.
2. Given sufficienly skilled mediation, you can teach any human who doesn't have an [[Autodidactic]] literacy to use any possible tool, as long as you have some type of physical aid.
3. Every human is [[Autodidactic]].
