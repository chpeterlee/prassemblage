Antifragile Agent P. Roxy bets the Devil (but is simply just teaching people)

What if Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is playing the 7 playing the devil, and it's 7 other people playing him against the devil?




**Not a Trick Question: Is Antifragile Agent P. Roxy's 7-Step Escape Tunnel From Ecosocial Collapse Antifragile Enough to Win His Bet With the Devil of the Entropy-Industrial-Complex and Keep His Soul? 

1. Everyone has the right to destroy themselves and withdraw from everything; but not destroy others and force others to withdraw. (AJAY)
2. True oppositional nihilism ends in a rejection of meaninglessness. Everything in the universe can [[Autodidactic]]ally teach itself anything over time. Everything co-exists in [[Non-binary]], [[non-linear]] and probabilistic antinomies. (OKSANA)
3. 70% of the population has been deskilled, undereducated and traumatized because of the budget cuts of the 1% in the 1980's. It is best to reframe them as the Postworkteriat, place them in safe spaces, and re-orient organizations and visions towards building postwork regions and infrastructure.  (TREVOR)
4. Art is techne; humans and non-humans are techne;[[neganthropic evolution]]is small groups of individuals inventing inclusively scalable techne before implementing a large distribution. (SELMA)
5. Post-work regions and infrastructure are the near future of humanity. Everything is quantum photons, matter and inferences self-organizing towards net Neganthropy. (JON)
6. The most likely group to resolve today's ecosocial conflicts are [[polymath]]s. (BORYANA and THOMAS)
7. Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is not Jesus, an angel or a saint, nor is he a demon, killer or trickster; he simply has verifiable .1% [[polymath]] grade skills and a history of inclusively scalable production of both art and non-art. Thus, the worth of his soul simply accurately reflects this. (AUSTIN)

  Ugh only like 10 artists in the world can think accurately.
  
  In that case, why dont we just give the current population of batsh-t insane artists a bunch of drugs and have them slamming images together stupidly?
