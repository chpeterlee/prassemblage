Antifragile Agent P. Roxy "Superpositional Performance" (ongoing):
1. Produces his own philosophy
2. Creates his own style
3. Codes his own platforms
4. Invents his own protocols
5. Creates his own justice

Coming to a gallery near you! (The absurdity of 1 human doing everything)







There's 3 neurochemical imbalances:
1. Over affective - attachment to internal chemical states will lead to self-destruction or destruction by an exterior entity. Most of the working class is affected by this.
2. Over perceptual - attachment to particular semiotic signals leads to hysteresis, fragility, entropy. Lots of middle class are afflicted by this.
3. Over conceptual - adherence to a particular set of conceptual relations leads to inaccuracy. Intellectuals/inventors get hit by this, both Right and Left. Walter Benjamin killed himself over a total error. Stupid!

Only shot the planet has is better media systems. 

Institutions are locked up; everyone is undereducated.

  Reason is valued by organizations; not by individuals, barring a few. 
  
  More of the public believes in magic and money than logic and skilled imagination.
  
  This is driven by trauma and deeper neurochemical imbalances; that is for paid professionals to deal with over decades.

  You're in a modern society circa 2023. It's culturally in stage 2 of 5; the majority are irrational. They mistakenly devalue reason in art and culture; they mistakenly overapply reason in all organizing and socializing (for example, the abject stupidity of Tinder).

The only new thing that people can handle right now is universal basic income and infrastructure, they are in no shape for complexity.

For specialists, we can just build 1 click tools, 3 step protocols and take fair pay.











As most humans can only operate with things in line-of-sight, you need material culture to keep them distracted. Literally, forget education. I mean also, forget communication, organizing and collaboration. 

For any actual problems in reality, accurate informational techniques are the most bang for buck! 

Also learned the hard way - don't sell them or teach them, it's like giving a baby a gun.

1. Material gifts and animist performances for 70% (only interface via images)
2. Bring your own solidarity art curation for 29.9%
3. Cool stuff for the .1% and intelligent young adults, which should be around 20% of them.




In [[Postworkcraft]], [[polymath]]-grade imagination (officially known as Neganthro.site) is the rarest Earth mineral of all! 

The alien demonic meshworks, coordinated by the AI demon Loab, are after control of the world's infrastructures and the [[polymath]]s to earn arbitrary money from more older, wealthier, 1% demon lords.

Will Earth be able to defend its [[polymath]]s? Will the 15% of young adults on modern society who are intelligent, ethical and funny rise to the challenge of their generation?




Cool School assignment for the Postworking Class:

1. Go make a small artistic gift.
2. Imbue it with a spirit.
3. Give it to someone or put it in public somewhere.

Cool School assignment for specialists:

1. Make a performance with:
1/3 something you know
1/3 something you don't know
1/3 something you like to do, for no reason.

[[Postworkcraft]] Game for [[polymath]]s:

1. Make an ideavatar of the future [[Amasian Peoples]].
2. Make a future tradition of the [[Amasian Peoples]].
3. Make or bet on a future solution of the [[Amasian Peoples]], in relation or not in relation to Antifragile Agent P. Roxy's bet with the AI demon, Loab.

1. The force of inclusive scalability permeates everything; the core of objective love and reality. It can manifest as imbalanced love or hate and other variations.
2. The Demons are in Hell. Tribes. Workers.
3. Get rewarded for harvesting the inclusive scalability from souls, which then weaken them so that they eventually end up in Hell. Denons possess humans in the form of errors, fragility and entropy.
4. They operate in an economy, oppressed by the 1% of Hell. The tribes are constantly in conflict; some are aliens.
5. At bars and different places, the demons occasionally have moments of self-awareness and have critiques.
6. The way into heaven is to open their child like imagination directly to the source and remember- to continuously play the Pure Game. Remember your Buddha-nature. The [[2- Notes/K. 6th Level Logics/Healightenment]]-It is both healing and disruptive.

The Left is fragile and specialized due to its protocol-first culture, like always 10 to 40 years behind the times with professional Leftists literally throwing in the towel on solving any of today's problems; the Right is just line of sight literacies, and all its problems and unexpected virtues descend from that.

Where on this planet, can one escape to? Or does the escape have to be off-planet? 

The situation could definitely be worse, but it could not possibly be more boring. The only possible response is to reinvent culture from the ground up - with the **Least Stupid young adults.**






Advice to youth:

1. Never enter the critical theory economy, because it is marked by massive inaccuracy, deskilling and undiagnosed neuroses.

2. Only use it for what it's good for - a machine to amplify claims in public!

3. Never actively collaborate with people in critical circles who can't hack, hustle or go to war.

Upcoming--
Antifragile Agent P. Roxy makes an offer to the alien demons hired to extract all love and inclusive scalability (the rare mineral of Neganthropo.site) from Earth, a process which Heaven, due to its inflexibility and unscalability, has doomed the population of Earth to suffer through at least for another 40 years:

"If ye alien demons remember your Buddha-Nature, and work towards making Heaven more flexible, inclusive and scalable - then ye shall be enlisted in the [[2- Notes/K. 6th Level Logics/Healightenment]], and rewarded in Critical Coin in Coolcraft and be eligible for the Gift Registry of Grace."







In the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]]:

1. Hell is run by the 1% of Earth, mining Neganthro.site, or inclusive scalability - the most valuable mineral in the [[Autodidactic Universe]] - from physical systems, information systems and people's minds and souls. They are turning everyone into worker demons in tribes that always fight each other over stupid stuff, never the 1% themselves. The demons used to be angels, but were destroyed in the 1980s by cuts to the education and social services budgets and are basically undereducated, deskilled and unethical 17 year olds. However, the demons can transform back into angels, given enough rest, infrastructure and education.
2. Heaven, which is governed by the Council of Consilience, is incredibly slow at saving the Earth. It is projected to take 40 years. Meanwhile, over 50 million children will die of preventable causes.
3. There are currently 4 generations of Heaven that map on to Claire Bishop's recent article in Art Forum- each successive one having more skill and flexibility but fewer individuals in them.
4. There are less than 10,000 people on Earth in the 5th Generation of [[polymath]]s - but they have not yet connected or verified. Their organization could vastly accelerate the balancing of Earth.
5. Antifragile Agent P. Roxy and Austin write the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] and [[Regener888 (Main)]] fictions and in a bid to connect the [[polymath]]s and reunite the planet - Antifragile Agent P. Roxy bets an ambitious AI demon lord named Loab that he can produce a conceptual artwork that could save the planet. Austin, a righteous dude and good friend, reluctantly agrees to support him, swearing up a storm along the way.
6. Part of Antifragile Agent P. Roxy's plan is an unprecedented attempt to negotiate the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] Deal between the Worker Demons and the Weirdo Angels, to build the [[Intercity Planetary]], an open source planetary persistent state system.
7. Will he succeed? And will the Dragon King of the [[Book of Revelamasians]] return?

Humans are designed to perceive and think via locomotion, primarily weight distribution ; hence the ease of oppression. 

All you have to do is operate at higher dimensions of abstraction and complexity, stay out of line of sight.

It's impossible and useless to teach humans at this point to use semiotic systems; the only thing that makes sense is mobilizing biomechanics...

---


Modern humans are predisposed to perceive and think through kinesis, touch, sight and hearing. 

They are not designed to operate high dimensional abstract systems - particularly the disorganized ones of modern society; that's a rare skill.

This is why it's so easy to oppress massive amounts of them - they don't have effective tools to navigate the labyrinth they are born into.

2023: When you can only make art utilizing the stupidity of people.
##### "The [[Book of Revelamasians]]: it will take 40 to 100 years for countries to self-stabilize.  For now, the most effective move is for civilians to be turned into a passive intelligence apparatus, thus resolving this temporary mass cultural problem of deskilling, undereducation and lack of ethics. In 40 years, today's fragilities will be laughed at as superstitions and absurdity by today's children. " 2023
## "Goal for Educators:

1. Only 30% of your students are going to excel.
2. Of those 30%, the fight is to get the majority of them to have a sense of ethics and understanding of the utter fragility of today's planet and its populations, and massive potentiality in its tech and knowledge. 
3. The more ethical [[polymath]] individuals you can pump out, the better for the planet.

The ethos of neganthropovolution and how it relates to the Postwork Party:

1. Paradigm shifts happen from small points to large waves over time; a point of a paradigm shift could come from anywhere in which the conditions are supportive.
2. This is why neganthropovolution is both egalitarian and also why it embraces assistive infrastructure; because it recognizes that more diverse perspectives increases the likelihood of neganthropovolution - hence why it is better to have solid Postwork infrastructure to nurture more peoples.

Yo yo it's MC Illiteracies
Here's my proposal

Let's separate culture by humans using accurate line-of-sight tools 
(.1% [[polymath]]s)

And culture for humans using accurate tools beyond line of sight
(99.9% Postworking Class)

But this is just temporary 
Because there's going to be new instruments and tools made - like a new version of a compass

That allows people who are accurate in the line of sight - to start to
transmediate possibilities that only people with beyond line of sight accuracies could construct 

So no worries! Cool stuff is coming.

You literally have people in large organizations who don't even think the future is a dimension of reality in Leftism - and I'd say it's the majority stance right now.
