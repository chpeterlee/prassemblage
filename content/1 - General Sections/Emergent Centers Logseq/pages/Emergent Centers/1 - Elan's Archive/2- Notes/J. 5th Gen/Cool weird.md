Notes for "Different is More" Essay:

1. For accurate functional things, you can simply just produce a simulator; also for generative things, you can produce a simulator. There - core functions of society are out of the way.
2. There are tons of humans today unabsorbable by societies who are phrased in various terms; lumpenproletariat, neurodivergent, etc. (Honestly I'd guesstimate 40-60% of modern societies.)
3. The social value of this population are usually salvaged in terms of labor or ethical value - as they can do some type of task, hence, they are people. OR- if we don't take care of them, can we call ourselves human?
4. I propose a third position:
-[[neganthropic evolution]]is probabilistic and variating. All of these unabsorbable populations can be phrased as simply the natural bio-mechanical variations of the evolutionary process of human species' itself.
- Thus, there is no need to justify their existence by tasking them with boring work or treating them as charitable duties. They are already functioning for the species as evolutionary variance machines and doing a crapton of "work". Our ethical duty is in recognizing how their humanity and our humanity AND our ethics is a constant game of probabilistic negotiation, doing our best in reducing damage and catastrophe over time while also humbly respecting the immense potentialities of our and others' processes of becoming.
- Now of course, you have to understand that our bodies and minds can probabilistically just produce a chemical imbalance and we can do massive damage to ourselves and others - that's part of the probabilistic game. These instances are quantitatively low, and instances of a body with recurring chemical imbalances that result in violence are lower. But it's part of the game, and there has to be clear rules of engagement dealing with a spectrum of violence. Thankfully, these have already been built across cultures through trial and error, and we can just compose the maximally inclusive and scalable spectrum of responses. 
  5. Now how do we actually address these bodies? After recognizing their evolutionary function, we need to throw out conformist culture, because it is not designed for high variance. We can cherry pick functional processes from high-variance environments like art, religious functions, etc to produce maximally inclusively scalable processes. Also - keep in mind that memory making and archiving systems will also be different - so for more complex interactions, there will need to be more work.
  6. Great - what are good takeaway slogans? Different is More, Peace is Minimizing Probabilistic Violence.

The worst possible escape room game / peace game:

You're trapped on planet Earth who's ecology will collapse in 9 years and is comprised of a society of 17 year olds.

Make absolutely bizarre, insane and weird things that actually save the planet.

  What the f--k is 2023 actually?
  1. A teenager can youtube enough stuff in 1 year to make a solid cybersecurity startup, hack and take over a region, or write a Nobel Prize winning physics paper.
  2. There are a kajillion new platforms and tools that are unprecedented in human history. There's a video tutorial for every possible tool/skill.
  3. Why is there so little effective resistance? I feel like people are thinking and doing way LESS than when I wrote my thesis on stupidity and planetary warfare in 2016.

Rule of thumb:
1. Never try to teach people a system; 80% will misinterpret, plus there's already a video for children. And still, they will misinterpret.
2. This culture won't change for at least 10 years until a new generation of younger humans mature, with less errors than the old generations.
3. Best strategy: grab performances and inferences.

"The U.S. is 40 to 100 years away from becoming civilized enough to pay out for Universal Basic Income, health care, arts-based education and off-market housing, and then begin producing planetary grade invention and art.

It's way too fragile for art or thought right now; it needs education, justice and postwork. 

But it can handle parties, poetry, prototyping, play and fairy tales!" 2023
