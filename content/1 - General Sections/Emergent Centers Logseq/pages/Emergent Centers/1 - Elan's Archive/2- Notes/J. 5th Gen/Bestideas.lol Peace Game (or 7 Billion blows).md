Antifragile Agent P. Roxy's 24/7 ongoing participatory performance:

1. You can hit me with foam darts, once. 
2. We will make a video.
3. You must write, "Peace" on the foam dart hit me, along with your best guess of what the best ideas are that exist on the planet at the time. If you have trouble thinking of them, go to [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Bestideas.lol]] .
