An accurate, non-judgemental assessment of the U.S. and 2nd World art scenes are that they are feminist vibe parties + slacker/stoner tech art. There is no critical intellectual discourse. The U.S. / 2nd World Art world communities are a French philosophy & German media art fan fiction club.

In the U.S., critical discourse only happens in film and architecture, but it is also generations behind the actual intellectual cutting edge. But this is fine - the art communities, due to their femergy/slacker stoner composition, are like 3 generations behind the intellectual cutting edge.






1. The film and architecture community in the U.S. is more critically aware than the U.S. art community; anyone with a modicum of technical and/or intellectual skill should immediately exit art and enter film/architecture.

2. The U.S. art community, due to the fact that it is primarily feminists, slackers and stoners inaccurately interpreting Euro utopian literature to include the most abject elements of society, unintentionally enacts a more radically inclusive politics than the Euro intellectuals proposed.
