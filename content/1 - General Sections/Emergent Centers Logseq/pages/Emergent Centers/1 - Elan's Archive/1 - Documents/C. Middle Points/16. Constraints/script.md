	  Moral compass:
	  
	  Jokes, music, dance, food and fashion for humans (pure stupid, inaccurate fun); bets, bots, images, video, text and architecture for systems (do accurate work).
	  
	  That's that - never cross the streams! Don't expect accurate humans, don't try to have fun with machines.
	  
	  Vision is inhuman; humans like lo-fi junky sh-t. HD is BORING. Never party with intellectuals; never converse with non-intellectuals.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Rules:
	  
	  1. For actual change: only make punk bets to change inaccuracy in people; bots to change fragility in systems. 
	  2. Never teach people - only engage in performances and fiction; people self-elect already based on their [[Autodidactic]] capacity.
	  3. Never make dumb games; only make games of art and philosophy, and expect zero learning.
	  4. Never expect statistical thinking from the average person; only refer to trained individuals and AI.
	  5. Teach 7 year old children 7 ideas that 
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Game:
	  
	  In 7 minutes, teach a 7 year old child 7 ideas that make them smarter than 99% of adults.

  Taxes on the wealthy are supposed to fund public service - it's just a service job, with standards and desired outcomes, but you get paid by a state taxing a particular slice of a population. Public service is a service economy, with no profit incentive.
  
  Human [[Autodidactic]]ism? Hell yes. You get a pat on the back for doing self-improvement. Winner? You. Congratulations.

  A poem by [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]], dead GOAT NFT and [[polymath]] artist:
  
  Don't educate; play
  Don't communicate; collage
  Don't collaborate; connect
  Don't conference; collect
  Don't care; create
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Amasia Live Editorial:
  
  A Speculative Democratic Speculation by Mamasia, 500 year old quantumdead werewolf mixed speculative arts fighter, working class[[0-Personal/Antifragile Peter Lee Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]mother and small business owner: How does localism actually work with universality? Let's think like a universal local restaurant - [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Ideapplebees]].
  
  1. All humans have stomachs.
  2. Some humans are allergic to certain foods.
  3. If you made a law for everyone to eat any given single food, someone with an allergy to it will die; if you made no laws then someone would make a law to force someone else to eat a food they are allergic to and then kill them.
  4. So what you actually need is a super flexible universal restaurant that can accommodate maximal local diets inclusivably and sustainably.
  5. Prior to the invention of the immortality elixir, people will die. But there is a world of difference between stupid and preventable deaths and ethical and unpreventable deaths. All a universal restaurant can do is simply attempt to minimize the latter, and then let the diners autodidact for themselves how to complexify and enjoy the constraints of their local palettes.
  6. Sometimes, locals get bored of simply eating and then apply to work in the universal kitchen; of course like any job this requires training. Without it they might accidentally kill a customer.
  7. In the end, most will end up working in the universal kitchen of [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Ideapplebees]]. It will take humanity probably 100 years to get to an 80% / 20% split between working in the kitchen and being a diner.

  Mamasia explaining the "telepathitechture" of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] of Amasia, [[New S.A.]]:
  
  1. Telepathitechture is the invisible [[Intercity Planetary]] architecture connecting and transforming existing physical and informational systems; it is what Timothy Morton refers to as a "[[Hyperobject]]".
  2. It ranges from degrees of virtualization to actualization; from being a single fleeting thought in one body's head to a 43 billion strong botnet and mixed reality media planetary infrastructure.
  3. There are varying degrees of skills manipulating it - from individual body's thought to planetary infrastructure.
  4. It can be constructed both in philostatistical proofs and also in teenage fiction.
  5. Visual expressions of the telepathitechture are relatively new, breaching a new threshold with prompt-based AI.
  6. Currently there is an alien invasion by the [[Xenabloom]], an alien mushroom coral, transforming the planet's telepathitechture towards the [[Neganthropocene]]; it has modified banana art phones across the Earth to gain self-consciousness and begin the Banana Revolution, where Speculative Socialism and Speculative Democracy to fight for the allegiance of regions through speculative cooking battles.
  7. A semi-opportunistic civic contractor, [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Playtheon]] is building multiple peace games to host the speculative spectacle. 
  8. They have contracted the legendary speculative operations unit, [[Regener888 (Main)]], to do all the greyhat speculative work. Amongst their current and former Grey Berets is Infamouse, a band of mice that sing various forms of speculative punk, rap, techno, folk and avant garde music.
