**[[Regener888 (Main)]]: 9 Years Left**

1.  Ray the Spiritual Squirrel and [[Quantumstein]] contract AF Agency and Plant Group to help actualize the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] - outside the strictures of the Council of Conciliance, which is being made ineffective by higher order machinations of Alien Demons. Antifragile Agent P. Roxy and Austin were simply working for them.

	- The Ark of Inclusive Scalability of the  [[Regener888 (Main)]] is the avant garde unit of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]]. The R.U.G.A.R.'s surround it's core, wearing Indefinite Singularity H.U.D. glasses to service the
		- Pure Game Engine - a quantum computational engine - which is running off of the
			- Monad source code magic of the Craft, expressed through:
				- A Quine - The Quine
				- A Buddhist Paradox - Form is Emptiness;emptiness is form.
				- Proclus - The One Neither is, Nor is One.
				- Thunder, Perfect Mind -  I am the utterance of my name.
				- The [[Autodidactic Universe]]
				  
				  3.  Antifragile Agent P. Roxy and Austin are trying to actualize and live within the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]]; Seeing the planet running out of time against Lord Dementropy, or Lord La Plazz, Antifragile Agent P. Roxy makes a wager of his Level 5 soul and his cross-world and state-space talents for the planet. If he can summon Shi, the[[0-Personal/Antifragile Peter Lee Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]Dragon King (1/3 myth, magic and machine defending the Silent Majority) to prevent collapse in time, then he wins the wager - and Lord Dementropy must halt his campaign for the next 10 years. If not, he works for Dementropy and gives his Level 5 soul, which there have only been 500 or so won, throughout history - thus elevating Dementropy within the organization and allowing him to outcompete his peers.  They pilot the Entropostroyer.
				  
				  4. Ray, [[Quantumstein]], [[Dr. Phil I. Stine]] and [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] and Neon Madonna disapprove and lose their shit. 
				  
				  5. The 5 Magi of the Craft: Squiddartha, Vin Jesus DieseLee, [[Elan Semiotechne]] and Mamasia and Herr Frog, comes and speaks the prophesy of the [[Book of Revelamasians]].
				  
				  6. The Redemption of the 7 Billion Churches of Amasia: The Coming of the Indefinite Singularity. [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/1 - Elan's Archive/1 - Documents/B. Middle Frames/10. Nitty Gritty/Shi the Dragon King]] . The Return of the Dragon King. Calling up on the [[Autodidactic Universe]] via Silent/Invisible Birth of an Invagination.
				  
				  6. The trick is via Protonoia: I AM THE FUTURE DEAD! Conceptual Trick. Suicide Contract.  + New Protest + Emotional Conceptual + Playful Pedagogy + Everyday DaDa. Punk, Abstract Diagramming via Q.I.S. and VR. Childish, brute, old images. Inject into Art History.  
				  
				  7.  White papers using music & AR HUD & Toy = Indefinite Singularity HUD. The Monad.

				  2023 is not 1970, 1990, 2000 or 2010; it is 2023. (Why I)
				  
				  1. There is a massive ecologies of NGO's , which also have the same problems of a few organizations run by the 1% distorting the field; for the most part, the small - mid size ones are doing good work, just alleviating the logistical burdens of society, thus making it more adaptive and antifragile. Are they going to overthrow the 1%, intervene in international coordination or stop wars ? 100% not, they don't have the capacity.
				  2. There is a massive crowd-sourced media apparatus (5 billion phones, 40 billion devices), so there really is no need to act as if we are on a stage, on a film screen, TV, or Reality TV even. These are older paradigms of media, they don't function. 
				  3. There is a massive proliferation of access to tech and tools; why bother going to school or even offloading or reifying engineering or research as a specialty (unless you can't do it) ? There is no need for that, totally ridiculous, just a limitation in [[Autodidactic]]ism, which unfortunately, will permanently shape lives.
				  4. Almost every relevant core tool of [[polymath]] thought is available online today, along with advanced knowledge management tools. Again, better off to teach the least fragile children, highest odds of planetary [[Antifragility]]. The rest should be given minimal roles in a post-work society.
				  5. It is 2023, nobody has yet proposed a coherent vision NOR a way to even discuss it amongst the incredibly disparate discourses, hence I have to do all this insane gymnastics like call self-care a game, speculation a modelling competition and thought as magic.
