  Useful, not universal!

  Visual Art and Culture, or Production of Techne  = Painting and philosophy (Knowledge)
  
  Expressivities = Moving image & sound, performance and drugs.
  
  The history of moving image is the gradual discovery of painting and philostatistics; the history of painting and philostatistics is the discovery of moving image, sound, performance and drugs.
  
  Keep painting and philosophy intellectual, best for thinking beyond line of sight; moving image and sound should be dumb af - best for thinking in line of sight!

  Moving image and sound shouldn't be used for making art. Art is invention.
  
  Moving image and sound is for culture. 
  
  Totally different, both are necessary. Obviously, the best is if you can do both, but then the problem is that there is such a small audience for mixed literacy work. But, eventually it will obsolesce single literacy works!

  Notes by [[Elan Semiotechne]], Antifragile Leftist on the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]] Deal:
  
  Both the Fascist Right and the Fragile Left are "Loud Minorities"; statistically small populations, can't think beyond line-of-sight, have no memory. They can be defused with sex, parties, drugs and bots in the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]]. Forget education; too late. 
  
  Most of the Silent Majority are specialists and cannot coordinate; hence only a few [[polymath]]s with tech will drive the planet invisibly.
  
  
  
  
  
  Speculative Wager from [[Elan Semiotechne]], Antifragile Leftist:
  
  The U.S. art infrastructure is way too underdeveloped for any type of coherent self-organization which would affect any change; however it's abundant with resources which are being utterly wasted right now.
  
  To act with any efficacy, it would be better off if it simply just gave over control to outside consultants from Europe and more culturally developed countries. Which is happening anyways!
