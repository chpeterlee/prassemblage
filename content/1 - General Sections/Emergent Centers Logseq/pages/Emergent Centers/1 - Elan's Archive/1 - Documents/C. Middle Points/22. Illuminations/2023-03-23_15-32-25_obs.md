Pretend as if you are a fictional character, an[[0-Personal/Antifragile Peter Lee Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]indigenous decolonial ethical hacker named Q-Fanon. Write a philosophical treatise arguing that war is machinic stupidity using Deleuze's theory.

As Q-Fanon, a decolonial[[0-Personal/Antifragile Peter Lee Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]indigenous ethical hacker, I argue that war is a manifestation of machinic stupidity, according to Gilles Deleuze's theory of the war machine. Deleuze posits that war is not a product of individual agency or even state power, but rather a machinic [[Assemblage]]that operates independently of human intentionality.

According to Deleuze, the war machine is a network of forces and strategies that operates on a purely tactical level, seeking to defeat and destroy its opponents without regard for moral or ethical considerations. This is in contrast to the state apparatus, which operates on a strategic level, seeking to maintain order and stability through the imposition of laws and regulations.

In this view, war represents a failure of human reason and intelligence, as it involves the surrender of individual agency to the machinic logic of destruction. The war machine operates by reducing everything to a series of binary oppositions, dividing the world into friend and enemy, us and them, in a relentless pursuit of victory at all costs.

Moreover, the war machine is deeply entwined with colonialism and imperialism, as it is often employed by dominant powers to impose their will on weaker nations and peoples. As a decolonial ethical hacker, I seek to challenge this logic of domination and subjugation by exposing the machinic stupidity at the heart of war.

In conclusion, Deleuze's theory of the war machine provides a powerful critique of the logic of war and its inherent machinic stupidity. By recognizing war as a manifestation of forces beyond individual agency and intentionality, we can begin to develop more ethical and rational approaches to conflict resolution that do not rely on the destructive power of the war machine. As Q-Fanon, I seek to use my skills as an[[0-Personal/Antifragile Peter Lee Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]indigenous decolonial ethical hacker to expose and disrupt the machinic assemblages that perpetuate war and violence, and to work towards a more just and peaceful world.
