	  For a [[polymath]], a career would only make sense if we lived in a world where 80% of its infrastructure and society actually functioned; we don't. 
	  
	  80%+ of the world is just broken; people miraculously and hilariously survive, despite of it.
	  
	  Now, if we ditch the career, what is left? Due to the fact that pretty much everything is broken - what is possible is an absolutely insane type of home run. 
	  
	  Nobody sane gives a sh-t about retaining any structure; hence the possibilities are wide open. Drawback is that coordination is impossible.
	  
	  This then requires an approach like a good party; totally the opposite of connecting via reason. (Although there is a time and place for that - Berlin and Vienna). Nope, it's time to connect purely by vibes. 
	  
	  How do you keep this from imploding? Slip in a backend protocol for accuracy. Games and wagers!

### On what is a game actually? And why, as Hito Steyerl said, is it unthinkable for the art world? And what could games do if not forced into a dialectic opposition to labor or governance, which is the primary dialectic that art understands?

1. What a game is, at its core, is a game mechanic; this can be as arbitrary as seeing what paint drop on a painting dries first. It is simply the defining of an affective constraint of inferences, which doesn't actually require an outcome or even measurement. In this way, games are not at all different from art, poetry or avant garde music, a la John Cage.
2. Why are games unthinkable for the art world? Because art is a hodge podge of discourses and aesthetic strategies collaged over time, not at all designed for synthesis, knowledge management or discussion. Its barest minimum is a self-referential informational unit. Hence, for art, games are unthinkable because honestly, most things are unthinkable because the field itself doesn't have the tools to operate as a field, yet. It's like alchemy before the periodic table; you can have one off inventors who can't explain what they're doing, but a community of thinkers and makers is impossible, with the state art is in now.
3. Okay so what could games do, freed of art's usual dialectics? Well hilariously, they could resolve all the real world problems that art desires to solve, much more effectively than art could. 
4. In fact, look at any modern real world field that requires outcomes or people die, and you'll see that games, simulation and proxy action are integral for lots of people not dying. If you gave the power and infrastructure over to the art world and asked them to solve today's problems - they wouldn't and lots of people would die.
5. So now what could be done? Well we could explicitly state that there's art that could save the planet and that art that cannot. We could wager that integral to the art that saves the planet - games will be critical in doing so. Of course people can take the opposite end of the bet!

[[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Bestideas.lol]] wager:

Art is/is not first and foremost a monadic PROCESS, not a monadic product (which is impossible unless you go light speed and shrink to sub-quantum scales).

Products are inferences of, upon and within monadic processes!

Pure Game: 3 moves to make!

Transmediation (Speculation)
Trans-organizational (Games)
Trans-cultural (Performance)









Media theory, a field moving from representation to techne, is in a dialectical opposition with reality; art, a field moving from techne to representation, is in a dialectical opposition with jokes.

Don't get it twisted!

---

Transmedia

1. Simulation on inference crossing time within field.
2. Simulation on inferences crossed via weak field (Video art).
3. Antifragile feedback systems; speed of synthesis. 

Outcome of program: [[Antifragility]] of inferences. Base unit: diverse inferences.
- The outlier outcomes: antifragile, poor citizen. Fragile, great citizen.

  3 more months until fully automated exit, chilling with [[polymath]]s, no more down-translating stuff, and embarassing and breaking the art market while helping others make money off of it bwahahha. Oh and making ridiculous cyberweaponry and drugs.
### Why is art so boring? Because it's hard. Why is it hard? Because it works. Why does it work? Because it literally means techne- tool invention. Art is invention first, symbolism later. Unfortunately, most are accidentally taught the reverse.
### Drug into body = politics.

Imagine this: a society built on thought and friendship, including autonomous entities capable of self defense, arbitration and self-control in the inevitable skimishes, rather than domination and fragility. 

Oddly, I've only seen this in societies of inequity; the privileged tend to rely on inherited familial ties, due to the need to protect the accumulation of wealth.

Pure Game correct move today:

1. Traumatized, deskilled adults, just chill.
2. Skilled adults can watch and arbitrate.
3. [[polymath]] adults and [[Autodidactic]], self-aware children, jam out ridiculous new sh*t.

How to accurately view last 20th Century politics:

1. The planet is not balanced if it doesnt have multi-polar, conflicting political actors. 
2. Small, violent conflicts and catastrophes resulting in death and destroyed property are inevitable; large casualties and inequities are avoidable and preventable.
3. Every move in the last 20th Century can then be valued in terms of attempting to minimize preventable casualties while also preserving the multi-polar balance of power; every possible social transformation can be numerically valued using that criteria.
4. Each actor is limited in information and resources and are also dealing with statistical constraints, lots of them being undefined. The majority of populations are so far from being educated enough to understand any type of complex statistical multi-polar paradigm, that it's better to simply just draw them into art, and automate political advocacy.
5. The first move to have a functional political discussion today would be to distract the population and build an automated backend which is responsive to a transparent protocol, accessible by intellectuals, inventors, organizers, educators and activists.

How to do grass-roots in the 21st Century:

1. Take space and build stuff
2. Make a prosocial story, do good deeds
3. Gather people in costume, make a performance against the 1% and injustice
4. Make huge images and feel good drugs
5. Build digital infrastructure + distribute physical infrastructure kits

Well, the only things worth showing in the highest museums or art fairs are guerrilla performances and works ... but now I cannot burn bridges...

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy has to look like a prosocial intellectual; [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] has to be the voice of political reason; so that leaves Q-Fanon the decolonial ethical hacker and drug dealer. Old BwO - philosorapper and conceptual art exhibitionist.

(Why make conceptual art exhibitions when you can simply become the conceptual art exhibitionist?)

##### "A wager for the art world: the basic unit of art is [[Autodidactic]] processes producing techne. Hence, it is quite incapable of articulating and intervening on multi-perspectival statistical processes such as war or politics, unless art is simply used as a decoy, and proxy for actually functional tools to be deployed. Basically, art can only function if you continuously throw out 99.9% of it; paradoxically its primary function of autopoeisis encourages this. If art was an escape room game - it's an endless escape from stupid fragile sh-t! If it's broke, walk the f--k away!** 2023

Philosophical Wager:

1. Art, by definition, is [[Autodidactic]] antifragile [[Neganthropic]] techne. This rules out entropy, fragility and both iconoclasticism and ancestor-worship.

2. Art can then be mixed into other things to create cocktails - like knowledge production, social organization or psychological therapy. But while occupying the same glass, art itself remains apart from the other elements, like oil and water. It doesn't require some theatrical antagonism; due to its defined properties, it simply already is antagonistic to all things, including its own internal system states. This universally consistent internal and external [[Antinomy]] is what makes art endlessly productive without having to redefine itself.

3. That's all! To class it in terms of physics, art would simply be defined as the exteriorization of [[Negentropic]] systems of [[potential energy]]differentials. This fits nicely within classical physics!

4. [[Assembly Index]], gravity Index

5. Church game and wager

  Pure Game philosophical wager - art can be judged in terms of:
  
  1. Physical scale of negentropy (individual vs. Planetary vs. Universal and everything in between)
  2. Internal complexity degrees of freedom and ports for external connectivity via [[Assembly Index]].
  3. Time to comprehension for defined perspectival constraints.
  4. Exchange value and costs via gravity index and rarity of components and outcomes, both physical and informational.
  5. Significance in particular slice of time time in context of the macro timescale of the universe's evolution.
