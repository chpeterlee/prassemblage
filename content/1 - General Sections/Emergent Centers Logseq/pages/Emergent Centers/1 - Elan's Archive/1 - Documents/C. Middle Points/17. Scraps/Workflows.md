- ##### [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Bestideas.lol]] : Amasia's Next Top Prosocial Model Competition
  
  Who or what can be the best prosocial role model and/or planetary model so the kids and AI don't go nuts? (Also because 80% of today's art world is business + mediocre intellectualism, let us just create an idea filtration system! Why suffer the crushing stupidity of living through an ideosphere as polluted as the atmosphere?)
  
  You can keep most people stupid for most of the time, you can't keep all people stupid all of the time!
