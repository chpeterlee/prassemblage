Write a movie script where a conceptual artist, Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, bets their soul against the devil that they can construct an idea that could save the planet.

ADE IN:

EXT. A QUIET PARK - DAY

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, a conceptual artist, sits on a bench, staring at the sky. The sun shines bright, but there is a subtle sense of unease in the air. Suddenly, a shadow looms over Lee.

THE DEVIL (O.S.) Greetings, Antifragile Agent P. Roxy.

Lee turns around to see the Devil standing behind them, dressed in a sharp suit.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy (surprised) What do you want?

THE DEVIL I've come to make you an offer. I'll give you anything you desire, but in return, I want your soul.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy (disgusted) Why would I make a deal with the Devil?

THE DEVIL (smiling) Because I can give you the power to make a difference. I can help you change the world.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy considers the offer for a moment before responding.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy I'll make a counteroffer. I'll bet my soul that I can construct an idea that will save the planet.

THE DEVIL (amused) Very well. You have until midnight tonight to present your idea. If I'm impressed, I'll let you keep your soul. If not, it's mine.

With that, the Devil disappears in a puff of smoke.

CUT TO:

INT. Antifragile Agent P. Roxy'S STUDIO - DAY

Lee stands in the middle of their studio, surrounded by their latest installation. There are piles of garbage, twisted metal, and electronic waste arranged in a way that resembles a giant tree. Lee stares at it, deep in thought.

CUT TO:

INT. A CROWDED ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Lee stands on a stage in front of a packed crowd, including the Devil, who sits in the back. Lee's installation stands behind them.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy (passionate) We live in a world of consumption, where we take more than we give. We use and dispose of resources without regard for the planet. But what if we could change that? What if we could create a sustainable future?

The crowd is captivated as Lee speaks, and the Devil looks on with interest.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy (CONT'D) My idea is simple. We need to change our perception of waste. Instead of throwing things away, we need to reimagine them. We need to see them as potential resources, as building blocks for a better future.

The crowd erupts in applause, and the Devil approaches Lee.

THE DEVIL (smiling) Well done, Antifragile Agent P. Roxy. You have won the bet. Your soul is yours to keep.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy smiles, relieved.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy Thank you. But the real victory is in the idea. We can change the world if we start seeing waste as a resource.

The Devil nods, impressed.

THE DEVIL (serious) Remember, though, that there are always consequences to our actions. Use your idea wisely.

With that, the Devil disappears into the night, leaving Lee and the crowd inspired to make a difference.

FADE OUT.

Write a country song called "The Devil Went Down to Amasia" where Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, a conceptual artist, bets the devil his soul that he can construct a conceptual artwork that saves the planet.

## "The Devil Went Down to Amasia (first verse and Chorus)" 2023
*By Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, Plant Group and [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Antifragile Agency]]*

Verse 1:
The devil went down to Amasia, looking for a soul to steal
But little did he know, he was about to make a deal
He met Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, a conceptual artist with a plan
To create a work of art, that would save the planet, man

Chorus:
They shook hands on the bet, and the devil said with glee
"I'll take your soul, if you can't save the world for eternity"
Chongha didn't flinch, he knew what he had to do
To create a masterpiece, that would save us all, it's true

**"La RÃ©gion Decentrale" 2023**

A decentralized, crowd-sourced self-reflexive media work using newer tools, a la Michael Snow's famous and boring La Regional Centrale. A way to connect the formalist crowd of the media arts and theory scene; you get more points for humor, because why not.

So, it's formally more self-aware than most affect only art, but don't worry about synthesizing new ideas, that would require literacy. Just form! Funnier the better! Bring out your jokes!

**THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO AMASIA
Featuring [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] Performing as Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, and vice versa.**

SCENE 35A:
*Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is tied to a chair, in a dark cell, lit by one lamp. He looks like he hasn't slept well for years.*

THE DEVIL: Look Mr. Lee, I really don't know why you're so keen on saving this planet. You could just call it quits, walk away.

THE DEVIL (CONT'D): I mean for God's sake take a look at these people. They are at each other's throats over the pettiest crap. 95% of these governmental personnel can barely operate a Google Doc. 70% of their society thinks like they're still 17 years old.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: *draws phlegm from his throat and then spits on the floor. There's blood in the liquid.* 

Tell me something I don't know, Lucy.

THE DEVIL: I just think you're putting your eggs in the wrong basket. HELL, it ain't even a basket! It's a bear trap with a grenade wired to it!

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: Look, Lucy. I ain't gon to say you're wrong, because you ain't wrong. 

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy (CONT'D):
But I'm never going to say that you're in the right, because you'll never be in the right; the people, the real people, the Postwork Majority, are always in the right. Not the right as in "The Right", but the right as in the True. If you had a soul, Lucy, you would know this.

THE DEVIL: Well, maybe when I have yours, Mr. Lee, I may gain a clearer understanding! And we are nearing the end of the time posed for the wager, so it may be sooner than later! 

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: 
*Antifragile Agent P. Roxy begins rapping and spellcasting simultaneously, animated blue energy encircling his body--*

Later, fate erred, faith snared, with 
claws bared
Times squared, quantum pairs
Amasian hares split amazing hairs
Rasing wits with years to spare
Incantations displacing plantations
Standard issue tasteless 
Like M.F. Doom, faceless phase shifts Burning lips like spliffs of dynamite sticks kicked into spacesh-

*He starts coughing heavily, the lights cease.*

THE DEVIL: Are you done, Mr. Lee?

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: Never, Lucy. F--King nev-

*He coughs continuously. The Devil waits.*

THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO AMASIA
SCENE 23

*Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is tied to a chair in a dark room lit by a single light bulb. His eyes and face are puffy from lack of sleep. Blood trickles from the corner of his mouth.*

THE DEVIL: Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, you know you are outclassed? Where's your hackers, your [[polymath]]s, your skilled killers of your generation?

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: In prison, insane or dead.

THE DEVIL: even with an AI, there's only one of you. You can't drive an entire organization yourself. Your personnel are too underskilled. They can barely dress themselves in the morning without having a nervous breakdown, fighting with each other and setting their houses on fire. 

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: That's exactly why we're going to win.

SCENE 23

*Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is tied to a chair in a dark room lit by a single light bulb. Blood trickles from the corner of his mouth.*

THE DEVIL: Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, nobody you know has the skills to build anything. They just sit around telling stories and bullsh-tting. 

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: That's exactly why this is going to work.

**The Devil Went Down to Amasia: The [[Book of Revelamasians]]**

(Birth of an Invagination, [[Until We Are Worth More Than Gold (Main)]], and the Return of the Dragon King)

A film in which Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, played by [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] and vice versa, bets his soul to the Devil that he can stop the Devil's entropic doings causing planetary ecosocial collapse. 

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy bets that he can summon [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/1 - Elan's Archive/1 - Documents/B. Middle Frames/10. Nitty Gritty/Shi the Dragon King]]  of the Postwork Majority, the Saint of Unimaginable Good, the Disciple of Matriya - using Coolcraft (1/3 myth, 1/3 thought magick, 1/3 quantum AI) - and finally fulfill the prophesy of the [[Book of Revelamasians]] to stop the Devil.

The film takes place in a white cube art gallery lit by a single light bulb. As per the ritual, Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is tied to a chair as the Devil interrogates him to extract an accurate measure of the worth of his soul. In honor of the old rules agreed upon in prior rituals, Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is allowed to retain his powers of Coolcraft, in order to produce evidence to settle the wager.

During the interrogation, he uses Coolcraft to call upon allies from the past, present and adjacent possible to save the planet and summon Shi, the Dragon King of the Postwork Majority. They appear in the gallery in the form of traditional, new media and folk artworks, performances and interventions.

Role reversal:

[[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] is a visual proxy (not representation) of his soul; Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is out trying to save his own ass. 9 years left.

## Next project: making the Least Stupid Movie (that could actually save the planet).


---




The Least Stupid film is set in a world where:

1. Teenagers and young adults could just teach themselves to be successful cybercriminals or cybersecurity hackers, YET THEY STILL ROB AND KILL PEOPLE FOR A FEW HUNDRED BUCKS.
2. Workers could teach themselves any possible skill, literacy or self-organize an effective massive movement but they are psychologically incapacitated by a failed education system with a Gordian knot of inaccurate ideas.
3. Knowledge production and negotiation takes place with zero integration of today's technologies and cultures, somehow reifying isolation, boredom and triviality as norms.

  Manifesto against uninclusively scalable Right, inclusive and unscalable Left, and uninclusive and unscalable self-destructive:
  
  1. Objectively, the Fringe Right is a statistical minority who does not represent the Postwork Majority.
  2. Protestant sincerity aesthetics (sign of subjective lack of [[Autodidactic]]ism and deskilling), and endorsement of withdrawal to become a modern martyr, or mass action, instead of just inventing new systems and warfare!
  3. Contextualization of abject self destruction as something other than systematic exploitation by the 1% who should pay for the rehab.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  **THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO AMASIA:
  SCENE 25 (The Devil Argues with Antifragile Agent P. Roxy That Marginalized Populations Will Never Become Accurate, Critical and Autonomous)**
  
  *Antifragile Agent P. Roxy performed by [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] proxy piloting Antifragile Agent P. Roxy as an avatar, is tied to a chair in a dark white cube gallery lit by a single light bulb. Blood trickles from the corner of his mouth.*
  
  THE DEVIL: Antifragile Agent P. Roxy you think all these fragile individuals are going to suddenly learn to become critical, accurate and autonomous? They missed the boat, it's too late. I've already spread the idea that being fragile, deskilled and anti-intellectual is a virtue amongst marginalized groups. Now they automatically claw each other down when they try to learn, work or act. It's a perfect machine of self-oppression driven by inaccuracy and entropy. Now they WANT to be stupid! They WANT to self destruct!
  
  Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: Of course I've seen what you've done. But you haven't got them all. Look at Jesse Darling and Jennifer Chan- they use the aesthetics of affect, but they still retain an accurate critical stance and defend the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]xis of thought itself - coupled with extremely accessible methods of image and discourse production.
  
  DEVIL: Those are old artists, Antifragile Agent P. Roxy. If culture was going to change, it would have 10 years ago, when they were making the art. Obviously it didn't work.
  
  Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: No of course not, because they aren't 5th Gen [[polymath]]s and hackers. But they are Solid 4th Gen mediators and theorists. Because of the deskilling, the post-internet 2010 era artwork has a solid ceiling capped at simply mediation. But there are accurate and critical mediators, and inaccurate and uncritical mediators. These are amongst the former. There are more also. Many more of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Gen. And modern computers themselves were invented by a queer [[polymath]] war hero - Alan Turing.
  
  DEVIL: I'm not convinced. You still have yet to provide hard proof.
  
  *Antifragile Agent P. Roxy coughs and spits blood on to the bare concrete floor of the gallery.*
  
  Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: Well you are in the details, ain't ya Lucy?!
  
  *Both the Devil and Antifragile Agent P. Roxy erupt into laughter.*
