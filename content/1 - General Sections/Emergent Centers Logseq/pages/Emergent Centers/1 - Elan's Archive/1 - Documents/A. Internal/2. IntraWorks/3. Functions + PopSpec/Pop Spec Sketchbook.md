  Thought experiment: would there be more happy and living and prosocial people on Earth in 30 years if everyone was taught [[Statistical Mechanics]], computer science, or art?
  
  Tell them the fascists and Leftists think they can't do it, they would rather just sit there, queerwash, get high, bullshit and die.

  The [[World's End]] Speakeasy: After the Age of Empires
  
  In the early 2000's, Ozan Atalan played the Age of Empires game with peers. The game is a city building and warfare simulator. Players build up small civilizations to fund an army, then win the game by destroying the other players.
  
  But what happens when a player ignores the win condition and instead chooses to build a sanctuary amidst a space designed to be a battlefield?
  
  Thus was born the sanctuary of the [[World's End]] Speakeasy: After the Age of Empires.

  The only thing that will unite the mid-tier of the planet rapidly is an all out A.s.s.ault on the 1%. Everything else is too slow! Time to attack with full, vicious, childish stupidity!
  
  Artists will never learn philosophy, math or science, hence they will be forever useless in any constructive effort.
  
  The only thing they can do is negate things; hence it only make sense to launch a massive artistic assault on the 1%.
  
  
  How to ethically live on a planet where there are 6.9 billion stupid humans who will not learn anything:
  
  1.  The built-in rules of the Earth and physical universe will reduce the number of stupid people naturally; there is no need to expend extra energy to do so. This can be wagered for and against.
  2.  People self select their intelligence. Autodidacts teach and correct themselves. You can't educate 99% of humans. It's a waste of time. Over time, maybe 40 years, there will be a culture of [[Autodidactic]]ism and [[polymath]] literacy. Until then, there are only about 10,000 people on Earth you can have an interesting conversation with.
  3.  There are good stupid people and bad stupid people. Good stupid people usually don't want anything more than a safe house, food, clean water and youtube and a painless death. Don't trouble them with more.
  4.  It is easier to make money from destroying bad stupid people than it is to help good stupid people; 99% of the time, good stupid people don't even know or care that they are stupid and will not pay for their aid. Over time, they may become less stupid, or they may not, it's totally random, and not anyone's particular responsibility.
  5.  It's better to just hang out with the least stupid people, then automate the minimum to keep the rest alive. Everything balances in the end anyways.
  6.  Okay, so now all the ethics are covered. What do you do with a planet that is 99% stupid?
  7.  All you can do is basically use them for jokes and pranks. Of course, the rules are that you have to treat them ethically. You cannot degrade them or get them killed.
  8.  So that's pretty much it. The best division of labor would be to hang out with the least stupid people, write up some crazy jokes and pranks, and then tell the 99% to perform.

  The majority of the modern Left, and the planet, should not be asked to complexify beyond these 3 goals:
  
  1.  Don't eat poison
  2.  Don't kill self
  3.  Don't kill others
  
  If a human born in the 20th Century can achieve that, and be happy, they have fulfilled their existential purpose.
  
  If they are not a self selected autodidact, it is better to live a happy life and die than to struggle and cause unnecessary burdens.
  
  In 40 to 50 years, when systems and culture re stabilize, we can ask this of more than .001% of the planet:
  
  1.  Self awareness
  2.  Invention
  3.  Intellectualism
  
  Until then, expect nothing, only engage via art.

  God having to deal with the representational art market is like being forced into a full body cast.

  Where is the Real Left?
  
  It's simple - individuals who have literacy with probability, logic, media and chemistry.
  
  They can be found through their texts and videos. These forms take all 4 literacies.
  
  The rest of the Left swarm opportunistically and to be honest are unnecessary for social transformation. The game today is grabbing the infrastructure and AI… which can be done with just a single skilled [[polymath]].
  
  But it's nice to have people to look over your code and systems for bugs!
  
  Also note, you can simply just scrape the data from the pandemic and get an 80% estimate of how literate / illiterate an individual is based on their actions and media output. So amazingly, we have a new dataset that would have taken decades to produce- a rankable list of the planet's intelligence by individual entity.
  
  ---
  
  The pandemic allowed for a planetary dataset providing accurate measurements of individual intelligence and organizational capacity.
  
  If queried properly, you get about an 80% accurate picture of any given entity's capacity.
  
  This would haven taken decades to construct otherwise.
  
  This is unprecedented in history; have to think more about the implications… but it changes everything.
  
  We can objectively proof how incapable the planet is and then estimate how many people will die per policy modification.
  
  ---
  
  Core Intended Audience:
  
  1.  Individuals who evidence literacy across research, technology, media and politics.
  2.  Games not to play, because these are simply just illiterate upper middle class: identity politics, conceptual fashion trend.
  3.  Goal - build a functional speculative market.
  4.  Any possible image and referent can be constructed and automated today via AI, so there is no need to dilute for the low literacy of crowds of consumers.
  5.  Everyone else is redirected to existing therapy resources. No need to build more.
  
  ---
  
  Rules:
  
  1.  Never engage with the undereducated in a conversation, teaching or therapy; only produce art, with a maximum of 2 premises given. Then leave.
  2.  Any possible image or referent can be constructed via AI and automated. Minimize collaboration to simply credits.
  3.  Assume an unequivoci
  
  ---
  
  Next:
  
  1.  Quit art, withdraw from the illiterate, automate a weird, random circus for them. Spend zero attention there.
  2.  Only build rigorously speculative things with literate, skilled individuals.
  3.  Wait out the 40 to 50 years to planetary restabilization and de-stupidification.
  
  —
  
  Simplest planetary cultural strategy:
  
  1.  Just make a clear division between illiterate and autodidact.
  2.  Then redirect the illiterate to a benevolent automated chemical circus where the aspiration is to die happy as peacefully as possible. Less is more.
  3.  Build all the future stuff with an extremely small amount of literate people, use it to phase through the rest of society. Don't distribute or teach, it's a waste of time. Balance the infrastructure invisibly, keep as many people alive as possible.

  2 Art Games:
  
  1.  The 99% Art Game - be happy. Make all the meaningless things that you enjoy.
  2.  The [[polymath]] Art Game - [[Least Stupid Prize]]. Fix the planet.
  
  ---
  
  For 99.9% of the population:
  
  1.  The game challenge is to form the planet's biggest art therapy group possible, simply doing things that bring you happiness.
  2.  Contribute a couple bucks, real or artistic, to things that will objectively save the world, including degentrifying your region.
  
  ---
  
  For autodidacts:
  
  1.  Game to hijack all media channels, form a functional speculative justice market, and fix the planet.
  
  ---
  
  Speculation, bet for or against:
  
  1.  Both the universal and individual have an inherent basis in accuracy. We can look at this in terms of both physical and informational systems.
  2.  Without accuracy, individual bodies and informational units die. If a heart pumps an inaccurate mix of oxygen throughout the body, the bodies die.
  3.  Without accuracy, the universe would collapse, and as we can see, so do informational systems.
  4.  It is accurate to say - “be accurate or die”, because it's the physical universe's law, doesn't care what anyone thinks. It kills inaccurate things.
  
  No more art collaborations, going solo!

  [[Least Stupid Prize]] sub-speculation by [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]], Relatively Accurate Leftist, Absolute[[0-Personal/Antifragile Peter Lee Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]A**Hole:
  
  1.  99% of the existing economy and infrastructure is like 40 to 50 years behind the state of the art, which will take maybe 10 years to reach awareness even in academic, military and R&D circles. There are going to be lots of unneccessarily dead and/or stupid people and ecologies in the next 50 years. After about 50 years, when most people above 30 years old today are dead, the Earth will restabilize, both through natural and organizational efforts. How many is up in the air. It’s possible for a total stoppage of the ecosocial crises in the next year, with 60 million children saved from a preventable death. Likelihood is incredibly low though without hacking, automation and a coordinated effort by the planet's [[polymath]]s.
  2.  Okay so most of the planet’s PAID thinkers and tinkerers, who simply sit and think and tinker all day every day, are about 40 to 50 years behind behind cutting edge. Now let's think about how far behind people are who are NOT paid to think.
  3.  This is the Left, the art world/market, and the public- they are another 40 to 50 years behind. Everyone has planetary smart phones but they are literally using concepts and culture from the early 20th Century. This won't change until probably the next 4 generations- so when all the millenials alive today are dead probably lol.
  4.  Okay so now we've got that out of the way - let's make a list of things that are a total waste of time, if you are a fictional [[polymath]] individual that is basically 100 years in the future (like say [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]]) - but not a waste of time if you're not:
- Research is a waste of time because it will take 10 years to gain visibility
- Entrepreneurship is a waste of time because it will take 40 years to actually build something cutting edge
- Art is a waste of time because they are 80 years behind and nobody has any skills. The highest ambition is to not have an anxiety attack.
- Educating the public is a waste of time because they are pretty much dehumanized and most of them just need basic human needs met.
  
  1.  So the only thing this leaves is:
- Trolling academies and saving the planet
- Hacking and suing corporations
- Sabotaging and publicly humiliating the 1%
- Selling [[Negentropic]] drugs and making insane films

  Got it - answer.
  
  The artwork that can save the planet is an app and an AI.
  
  The rest is just a spectacle or bait to get people to install it or proxy it.
