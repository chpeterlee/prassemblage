My artistic practice  improvises queer ecosocial arbitration processes aimed towards build post-work collectivities, through both art and non-art means. These processes synthesize into ecologies, socio-economic contexts, knowledge disciplines and technological infrastructure.

In order to connect to contexts, the mechanics of my practice  adopt the aesthetics and design of traditional, popular and speculative forms of widely distributed culture. This results in playful, poetic and pleasurable compositions drawing imagery from religion, memes, academies, politics and games while maintaining the complexity and rigor of a peer-reviewed paper.
