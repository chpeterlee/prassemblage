# Life Worse Than Death

There are states of being technically alive that are worse than death, which are useful then to produce a relatively accurate comparative index for states of life across circumstances.

The worst possible state would be: 

1. **AFFECTIVE:** Being tortured to a pain threshold where you maintain consciousness but can barely apprehend the next moment, while simultaneously chemically repressing your dopamine and inbuilt adrenaline responses. Your nerves are systematically stimulated via technological and chemical instrumentation so you feel pain that wouldn't be possible otherwise.
2. **PERCEPTUAL:** Having every single socio-cultural-bodily boundary and every single person and object you use for your personal and social navigation systematically and violently transgressed, denied, destroyed, reconstructed, modified while you are bound and forced to witness.
3. **CONCEPTUAL:** Being kept awake constantly, with just enough sleep so you don't die or trigger an organ failure, and also being forced to respond to an arbitrarily shifting and random system of rules and stimuli, with an arbitrarily shifting and random set of consequences, both positive and negative.
4. **COSMIC**: Having a quantum-chemical machinic apparatus grafted to your body which carefully senses your bodily, perceptual and conceptual changes and keeps you alive perpetually; if you ever reach a point of equilibrium or you die, a quantum bomb is triggered which collapses the universe at light speed. Hence, it is in the best interest for every single other being in the universe to keep you stuck in this state of Life Worse Than Death forever, or they all die.
