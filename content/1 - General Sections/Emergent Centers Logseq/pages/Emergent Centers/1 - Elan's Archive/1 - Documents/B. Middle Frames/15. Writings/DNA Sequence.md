  Cultural strategy:
  
  1. Free culture of synthesis for the antifragile intellectuals; don't water down, don't post-produce, keep it raw. This is the @Neganthroposcene.
  2. Watered down consumer culture for the masses. 80% fun, 20% [[Antifragility]], 0% expectations. (Drugs, games and food - this is @FforFragile)
  3. Automated democracy and data-backed justice. Never trust a human for accurate justice. Escape the fragile masses ASAP, only interface via media. (@databacked)
