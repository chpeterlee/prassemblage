1. Critical conversation is a game of claims played with words, images, multimedia and physical reality. 
2. Claims can be qualified in terms of comparative accuracy. Accuracy of claims transcends genre of mediation.
3. No single emotion, identity or method of mediation adds or decreases accuracy to a claim; this also means that emotion, identity and novel modes of mediation can be and/or improvised without adding or decreasing the accuracy of a claim.
