# More Art = Less Stupid World

Most humans don't develop the skill or physical neural infrastructure to imagine text, images, audio, space, materials.

This is why there is all this ridiculous crap in culture/myth/religion about hearing voices, having visions, etc - because the skill of imagination isn't distributed. 

This is also why anything requiring sustainable statistical complexity built on foresight, imagination, accurate function has extremely low odds of being invented by the bulk of society.
## Media Clones for Unskilled and Fragile; Small Group for the Skilled and Antifragile
## 99% of modern adults should be in some form of rehabilitation, therapy or schooling. What to do with them? Put them in a media matrix. They pay for it, or the state/institution does.
Okay, so next is to phrase the problem of intellectual fragility and its ramifications on collapse.






Modern Cultural Forms to Target:

Memes
Tik Tok
Aggregator Site
Only Fans
Direct Messaging
Squishmallows
Transactions
Stream rooms

Invention is a rare skill, got it, loud and clear.

Functional Rules Forward:
- No teaching
- No peers
- No visibility
##### Reframe the efficacy of art; it's the only existing modern field that consistently executes parallel computation.

For the imaginative: Antifragile Agent P. Roxy
### Why Does the 99.999% Need [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]], the [[Non-binary]] Sculpting Superhero and not Antifragile Agent P. Roxy?
Because for the most part, they are missing critical pieces of education in order to function autonomously as an adult human. Hence they need rehab, therapy and schooling. States are supposed to fund this, not private individuals like Antifragile Agent P. Roxy.

Antifragile Agent P. Roxy is an individual who engages in peer exchanges; [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] is a [[Non-binary]] cast of human incapacity that exists today due to the mold produced by neoliberal budget cuts, policies and military coercion.
# Why [[Non-binary]] Sculpture aka Conceptual Digital Art?
- Increased parallel computation and higher complexity. ([[Non-binary]] Arbitration, Net Negentropy, Higher [[Assembly Index]].)
- Less actualized catastrophes and lower energy costs. (Less negative nonlinear externalities, more positive.)
- The entire problem of the planet is that neoliberal economic, legal and military policies eviscerated the distribution of the intellectual, imaginative and statistical skills to accurately affect the planet's infrastructure positively. The solution is not more anti-intellectualism, unimaginative and statistically inaccurate thought and action.
- Good apples, poison apples. Statistics over time.
- Quantum Rabbit vs. Classical Rock.
