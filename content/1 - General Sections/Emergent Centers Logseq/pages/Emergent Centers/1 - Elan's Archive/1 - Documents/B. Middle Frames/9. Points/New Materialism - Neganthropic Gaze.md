## [[Antinomy]]'s [[Non-binary]] Sculptural [[Hyperobject]] Wedding Vows and Magic Circle Art Game:
## 1. It is a speculative set of artworks, exhibitions, lawsuits, culture and inferences that are most likely to prevent planetary collapse and produce post-work regional republics.
## 2. Part of it is in the future.
## 3. Inferences can be verified through statistical review which operate according to the statistically mechanics of your heart.
## 4. It can be speculated, produced or verified in parts or whole by human, machine or non-human in any combination.
## 5. Each component can be verified in terms of the 5 Degrees of Freedom to output net negentropy utilizing bounded entropy and bound rationality.
## 6. It is an inferential game of [[Autodidactic]]ism. Much information is an internet search away.
## 7. The game is most likely to be won by [[polymath]]s, but because human memory is a 7 second short term memory loop, even a 7 year old is 7 seconds away from producing planetary solutions that could prevent planetary collapse and produce post-work regional publics that also bring conciliance for 7 generations worth of illegal colonial injustice.
### 8. All of this is documented via quantum internet by [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/1 - Elan's Archive/1 - Documents/B. Middle Frames/10. Nitty Gritty/Shi the Dragon King]]  , who is shooting the film [[Regener888 (Main)]] which is a speculative film that can save the world in the process of filming it.
9. [[Shi]] only shoots the future version of you who knows how to save the planet and does the right thing in the present.
10. We are all [[Hyperobject]]s in accordance to the Star-eye-heart system - your body already knows and is doing the right thing. Your brain sucks.

  As is, how can public institutions and institutional personnel operate?
  1. Public institutions and institutional personnel are based off of a model of church. They are self-contained systems that cannot survive outside their host environments. Drop them in the real world, they will be destroyed.
  2. Can they be retrained? Over time, eventually, yes. But it would take a massive effort and budget due to cultural and organizational inertia. It's cheaper and more rewarding to simply just educate the youth better.
  3. What to do then with existing organizations and personnel? It's better to "flatten" the institutions. Instead of a church - simply have a single pane of stained glass window that filters for a specific spectrum of light. This will also make the educational process more bearable and less agonizing for both teachers and students when outcomes are well defined as having a more complex general intellect coupled with technical skills.
  4. This means obviously, accurately defining which spectrum to filter for. This requires philosophy, science and arts.
  5. How to get there? Obviously create a split strategy. Do the minimum to fulfill obviously stupid existing standards and processes, and then transition to the better ones over time.
##### Goal of any higher education institution: produce individuals with more complex general intellectual skills + adequate technical literacies. You cannot have individuals with one or the other. It is statistically better to have individuals with limited versions of both legs, rather than one overdeveloped leg alone. Additionally having one leg, or no legs, does not justify stigmatization.
##### Answer? Art + Tech programs, not one or the other alone. Also, a properly structured art + tech program in an unranked space will produce more competent individuals than an art or tech solo program in a ranked space.

"A [[Non-binary]] popular speculative painting diptych: the most valuable form of art today would be to simply articulate statistically verifiable solutions to the planet's crises, written directly to an audience that has adequate literacies to understand and implement them accurately. 

To those who don't have adequate literacies, it would be framed as a puzzle game, like Wordle, and then distractions and entertainment would be provided as more interesting and viable options for them. 

The ones who refuse redirection into stupidity, endure hardship and persist in [[Autodidactic]]ism, turn them towards art and tech educators who will invest the time in their development." 2022
# Problem Space:
1. Today's human adults have a massive deficit in their ability to execute parallel computation. They are 50x more unlikely to produce solutions to today's crises than a 5 year old.
2. The fields that have promoted parallel computation- philosophy and art - have not aimed it at real world problems. They will get people killed or get killed in the context of violent states. Even thinking about the problem of inevitable death, an age-old use of philosophy and art, is triggering. Any real world problem that is not framed in a digestible artistic or philosophical language in relation to 90's post-modernist culture is incomprehensible to most of our existing philosophical and artistic apparatus.
3. Okay so what we can then do is redirect the artists and philosophers to become educators, error checkers and myth makers; [[polymath]]s engage with kids primarily to visualize the problem of adults' cognitive incapacity, which immediately cuts out any incorrect attempt at thinking the existing professional sphere could possibly solve today's crises.
### Audience: Forget talking with Hito Steyerl, I want to talk with Hito Steyerl's kid about how they, or anyone, could be the next Alan Turing - but it's more likely for a child to do so, and it's better for adults to just make art parties that have nothing to do with actually making art.
