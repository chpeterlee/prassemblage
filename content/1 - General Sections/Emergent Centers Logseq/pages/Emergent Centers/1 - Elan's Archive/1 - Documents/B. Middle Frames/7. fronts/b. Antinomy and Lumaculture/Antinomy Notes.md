2. Difference in both physical and informational systems tend towards negentropy over time.
3. Net negentropy in a system can be measured in a range of accuracy through both qualitative and quantitative means.
4. Using an [[Assembly Index]] to calculate connective ports, degrees of freedom and threshholds.
5. Failure and pain and crisis is inevitable, but the degree and length of time which it lasts is modifiable
6. Our artistic material and skilled craft is the crises themselves, our product is a post-work republic.

2000's: make art even though the process is utterly miserable and everyone hates it. (Misapplication of worker/entrepreneurial culture to art, because at that time that's what the media was proliferating, because it's composed of a bunch of undereducated specialists without training in critical theory, and most people are peer pressured as easily as 7 year old children.)

2022: don't fucking do it if it's a miserable fucking process and if it is, also tell someone else to fuck themselves (including me). Then invent a better process that doesn't fucking suck, make fair market value off it and laugh off the lack of imagination. Respect older generations for their strengths, accurately critique their failures in the present.

normalizing preventable stupidity, disorganization and destruction
with no end in sight, in the face of
10 years to planetary collapse and
12,000 children dying of preventable poverty per day.]
## Part 3: GPT-3 Assemblaged Dialogue.

(SETTING: Q-Fanon and Antifragile Agent P. Roxy poorly photoshopped in the Cool School of Amasia painting. Zero attention paid to the statistically verifiable stupidity of making something aesthetically attractive, simply just focus attention on the statistically verifiable value of the information being conveyed. Also, draw direct attention to actually modern aesthetics, while making a nod to the [[Antifragility]] of the past and not submitting to its current comparative fragility.)
##### Q-FANON (FICTIONAL PROXY FOR A STATISTICALLY VERIFIABLE [[polymath]] INTELLIGENCE):
	There's 2 reactions you could possibly have now: rejection or affirmation. However, there's  only 1 correct reaction - affirmation.
##### Antifragile Agent P. Roxy (CONTRACTED PERFORMER AS A NORMAL, EVERYDAY SPECIALIST LIKE YOU):
	How can there only be 1 correct reaction?
##### Q-FANON (FICTIONAL PROXY FOR A STATISTICALLY VERIFIABLE [[polymath]] INTELLIGENCE):
	Because, Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, the claims and stances issued prior derive from my religious faith; the Church of [[Non-binary]] Law, [[non-linear]] Peace & [[Neganthropic]] Love. All statements have statistically verifiable value in alignment with these 3 elements."
##### Antifragile Agent P. Roxy (CONTRACTED PERFORMER AS A NORMAL, EVERYDAY SPECIALIST LIKE YOU):
	Okay, so what does that mean?
###### Q-FANON (FICTIONAL PROXY FOR A STATISTICALLY VERIFIABLE [[polymath]] INTELLIGENCE):
	Basically, my claims and statements are not mere 'opinons', as accorded to an individual in standard nation-state society - they are expressions of my faith. And thus, they are also protected legally as such.
######  Antifragile Agent P. Roxy (CONTRACTED PERFORMER AS A NORMAL, EVERYDAY SPECIALIST LIKE YOU):
	Okay, where is this going? Remember I'm a specialist. I can only intake 2 to 3 new ideas a day. I have a 7 second attention span. Anything requiring more than 2 logical steps and my own thought is taxing me. I'm too stupid and tired to save the planet. I care more about my obsessive personal trivialities that change nothing than everything and everyone dying because I physiologically have an underdeveloped neural ecology. I need to eat a pizza.  I'm crying and I can't help it, although I obviously can.
###### Q-FANON (FICTIONAL PROXY FOR A FUNCTIONAL [[polymath]] INTELLIGENCE):
	Exactly. So everytime you do this ridiculous stupid incapacitating act, you are impinging on my religious faith and thus I can exercise legally sanctioned or ethical action to articulate you as such, bypass you or modify any type of contractual relation between us to statistically verifiable correct values. And don't feel bad, because you are like 99.9% of the middle class, Left and Right.
###### Antifragile Agent P. Roxy (CONTRACTED PERFORMER AS A NORMAL, EVERYDAY SPECIALIST LIKE YOU):
	Oh my god, thank god, you can just bypass me and my stupidity and exhaustion and incapacity. Thank you. Let me pay you back the money you hired me with. This is way more beneficial to me in the long run than you trying to teach me and wasting all your time and energy.
###### Q-FANON (FICTIONAL PROXY FOR A FUNCTIONAL [[polymath]] INTELLIGENCE):
	I agree. See you next class in the Cool School! Stay out of the way of the actual [[Autodidactic]] kids! Make sure to quarantine your fragility! Not everyone is as dumb and tired and cowardly as you! This is also actually real hope because now you know how trivial your problems are and that your constant collapse does not mean a permanent collapse - it's just temporary! Make sure to download the app, and every day you're not dead from your own stupidity and incapacity to sue, hack and sabotage the 1% and 100 most deadly corporations who created your fragility, you get 1 point buddy!  Also stay out of the way of the [[polymath]]s and [[Autodidactic]] children! Thanks!

### Knowhikavka[[Shi]] of Amasia:
'Knowhikavkashi' roughly translates from Amasianese into 'people of knowing Amasia'. Their traditional mode of shelter is called an "arthouse", built from lengths of inferences lashed together via quantum statistics. Their "arthouses" are warmed by hearths that burn "statistically verified bullshit". Since the confederation of the "knowhikavkashi", they have fought valiantly in Wolrd War Fragility against the quantum Entropifleas who through entropic misinterpretation and conceptual error, suck the lifeblood from perfectly sound [[Negentropic]] concepts.

The Knowhikavka[[Shi]] are known to wear jewelry made of imagination, the rarest of all Earth minerals.

They excavate the future using the media of the present.
# Currently:
1. The public pays ungodly amounts of money to institutions and corporations for entropic services, curriculums and infrastructure.
2. There are [[Neganthropic]] services, curriculums and infrastructure.
3. For the same price or less they can receive quality services, curriculums and infrastructure. 
4. The burden is ultimately on states, cities and institutions to demand and distribute resources from corporations.
5. The population right now is so undereducated, tired and demoralized that it's inconceivable for them to do anything but nihilistic work, drugs and sex and whatever else.
6. Answer - exteriorize the statistical verification capacity of institutions, provide clear pricing mechanisms for the public and automate civic demands for compensation from corporations. 
7. Visualize this in art first.
# Why not just issue statistically verifiable competence tests and scores to individuals who can move organizations?








We can just say the ontological unit of colonialism and neoliberalism = entropic [[non-linear]] transactions. Decolonialism = [[Negentropic]] [[non-linear]] transactions.

Its tools : military coercion, economic and legal policies.  Thus we can calculate damages and reverse it precisely in an[[0-Personal/Antifragile Peter Lee Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]"Decolonial Triangular Trade":

1. Individuals with statistically verifiable [[Negentropic]] services, systems and tools that operate beyond line of sight accuracy and imagination.
paid by
2. Institutions and governments requesting and administrating funds from corporations and the wealthy.
3. Delivered to the public for free or an a pay per transaction, fair trade basis. They then either self or proxy advocate for statistically verifiable [[Negentropic]] services, systems and tools. Risks and misery and disaster of line-of-sight only accuracy and imagination are conveyed. Rarity and value of beyond-line-of-sight accuracy and vision also conveyed.

Roxy have been collaborating theoretically and [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]ctically since 2016 in different locations. The duo criticizes the romanticizing yet insoluble terms of the Anthropocene's current ormulation of ecological destruction by anchoring its core engine in 1980's neoliberal military interventions and socioeconomic legal policies which result in a culture that otherizes and commodifies the vulnerable and the nonhuman.

Some recent history:


The 70s were a coalescing of post-war sentiments, resources and syntheses.

The 80s hit, massively wounded the infrastructure of the planet.

90s, we midsize conflicts proliferating due to the socioeconomic constraints placed in the 80s. 

00s, we see the growth of technology and the simultaneous underdistribution of wealth. 

10s, we see dystopianism, accelerationism and a "darkwave", most likely to pierce the filter bubbles emplaced by a now thick network of algorithms and extremely centralized telecoms infrastructure 

15s, we see acceleration actualize in distributed pockets, along with a degree of maturation of newer distributed technologies

16s - 19s we see the adoption of new technologies, a glimpse of a new culture of super empowered individuals

20s - 22s, tech is moving towards edge computing for the most power with least cost in history, the planet's infrastructure is exposed to be more fragile than ever, small groups begin blindly threading together new multi-regional arbitration networks**
