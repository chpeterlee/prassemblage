Good! It's good to have options. You always have choices. So here's the 3 possibilities that can come with the same material of your psychological and social state:

1. Talk to a therapist or a paid professional.
Benefit: structured environment
Cost:

2. Talk to a specific friend like nihan, get 1 on 1 emotional feedback.
3. Talk in the Cool School discord, with others facing issues, possibly get actual help for your situation from curators or engage in art therapy
5. Talk to antifragileagency, build an artwork that solves the systemic issue affecting billions of peope who feel, do and say the same problems as you.
6. There is option 5: don't talk to anyone, [[Autodidactic]]ally construct a mechanism to solve the problem.

The benefit:
You don't have to talk to anyone.

The cost:
It's hard and rare.
