Humans should be engaging primarily in the process of thinking. Thinking is not education; nor is it producing principles. It's an endless process of inference and questioning.

That's what humans should be doing. Not education, not work - simply engaging in lines of questions, continuously.

This is also the best bang for buck with art; it does not produce anything other than thought. In cultures with so little of it, it's the last thing expected - and is basically like throwing a stick of dynamite into a gas station.

  On Democracy and [[Antifragility]]:
  1. The first step in democracy is to separate a proposition and its statistical effects on a physical locale from any particular speaker. In object oriented democracy, we have equality of thought and capacity to measure a thought in terms of its statistical effects, independent of who voices it.
  2. Then we can look at say something like [[Antifragility]], and extract its most useful propositions, primarily dealing with statistical uncertainty, incomputability and also complexity without having to adopt the stupider parts of the concept or the author.
  3. This way we can bypass the tone-based disputes and simply proceed with less fragile thinking - which actually just leaves Nassem Taleb behind, very quickly, because he is not that complex, tbh.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Cool School of Art for the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]]:
  1. The Cool School is composed of antinomies of inferences (or mutual contradictions in logics). Antinomies can be gauged in [[Antifragility]] for a given task using both philosophy and statistics for up to 5 generations of complexity - if desired.
  2. Multiple antinomies can co-exist. No need to destroy an existing one. For example, a 5G [[Antinomy]] for a task does not need to erase previous generations; neither should previous generations destroy the newer. One entity may be 5G in 1 aspect and 1G in another. It's more interesting to simply just mix value systems together for mutual benefit like chemistry.
  3. Antinomies can be defined or undefined as it pleases the one defining it. No particular single mode of valuation is all encompassing.

Next: an actual new use of today's technologies to stop stupidity.

What else is there to make?

The medium today is philosophy, statistics, money and law. Everything else is shadow puppets.
