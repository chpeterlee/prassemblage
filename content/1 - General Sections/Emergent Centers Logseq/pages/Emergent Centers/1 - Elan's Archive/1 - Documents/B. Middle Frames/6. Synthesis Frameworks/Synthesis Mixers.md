### Conceptual Artwork: "" [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] [[Intercity Planetary]] Service Announcement: You Want Quality, Verifiable, 5G Art That Ain't Neoliberal Bullshit or Fascist Inaccuracy That Fucks Your Kids Up With All Your Inaccurate Trauma? Fuck You, Pay Me. Fair Market Value, Nothing More or Less. "", 2022
# Conceptual Artwork: " The Cosmic is Contractual is Critical is Personal is Political" [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] and [[State Space AI]] AI, 2022
# Conceptual Artwork: [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] is Recruiting Individuals for the ARTmy of Amasia using the Open Source Equality Specifications.
## 1. What Doesn't Matter:
- Race, sex, class, age, culture, species, if you are dead or alive.
- ## 2. Who Will Be Redirected to Less Demanding Programs and/or Roles:
- Submissive/dominating individuals,  traumatized/non-[[Autodidactic]] individuals, obsessive/amoral individuals.
## 3. Looking for Individuals With Following Demonstrated Behaviors:
1. They stay calm and don't fold, submit or beg under pressure, and have no fear of death, exile or prison. They fight, argue and resist irrational authority and abuses of power. There is no such thing as giving up in their vocabulary, but there is wisdom and skill in improvising tactics and planning strategically. As such they, are constantly engaging in [[Autodidactic]] study and synthesizing, testing and complexifying.
2. They are extremely self-disciplined, self-organized, accurate while being non-judgemental and liberal to others who are undisciplined and disorganized. 
3. They consistently execute minimal accurate corrective actions, usually imperceptible to the inaccurate.
4. They break rules, forge, cheat, scam and [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]nk - but never hurt anyone, never get greedy and never get caught.
5. They have an unwavering internal code of Robin Hood ethics - they always help those around them with less. They can be homeless, possessionless and near death and maintain a lucid sense of humor in the face of death.
6. They are able to properly structure symbols and cultural frameworks for maximum flexibility and minimal entropy.
7. They value and appreciate history, complexity and novelty simultaneously. They do not fall prey to trends or stimuli and they do not stigmatize or stagnate.

# Thou Shalt Heal
It Shalt Suck
##### [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] [[Intercity Planetary]] Service Announcement to Anyone Who Sucks at Accurate Thinking (aka Are You Inaccurate? Chill the F__k Out, and Play, Don't S[[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]y. More Intelligence Artificiality, Less Inaccurate Criticality).
Forget accuracy, it's not for you. Slow down. Don't do sh-t you can't.
# Think less. Eat healthy. Meditate. ## The planet dying is more important than anything you will ever experience
or think about, and you will only f-ck up the people actually able to solve it by trying to but sucking and f-cking it up and then asking them to tell you accurate information you won't understand.
# Do some shrooms, read books, 
kill illiteracy, become killiterate.
### Make jokes, not critique. Take naps. Listen to Manuel De Landa, not this crazy inaccurate Marxism! Good luck, I've quit art, except on an accurately contractual basis.
# Fuck Foucault, Kiss [[Statistical Mechanics]], Pay [[polymath]]s, Forge Autographs, Scam Instagram.

Yo Gen Alpha
This is [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] of
Generation Killiteracy
Rocking mind M I C's textually
Proxied politically through
Antifragile Agent P. Roxy, former artist contemporary - quits art to make art

World entropic only [[polymath]]s can stop it
Left and Right knock kneed fragile from inaccuracies
can't calculate statistics necessary, nor leverage lawsuits precisely

Still attempts to kill illiteracy with skilled literacies
fuck ill will, dialectics self reflexive
Hegel had one simple fucking directive
Don't fucking think from just one perspective
Even Zizek said this - a countervailing theory is always imperative

Deleuze and Kant disrespected for inaccurate dissensus
Simply just young [[Autodidactic]] reflections

All good, everyone is traumatized
From Reagan And Thatcher's lobotomy of the planet's mind
Slashing education budgets by 50%
Unleashing uneducated individuals into the universities, government



The fuck you expect
Bottom of the barrel teaching the abused and the used
Bad sex and worse texts




But fuck it ain't your fault ita

Gen Alpha if you got the discipline
make money and disappear.

You will do more as a speculactivist and cutting edge hacker than you ever possibly could in any visible organization.

There's 10 years left to planetary collapse.

If you prevent planetary collapse, I'll buy you a beer.

  [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] Thoughts: there should literally be a throttle on specific individuals' information intake per hour. 99% of people only have line of sight accuracy and can handle about 2 to 3 new premises per day. Without [[polymath]] literacy and ethics, new information given to a modernized human has a 90% chance of being misinterpreted and misused.
  
  Basically, most humans should be limited to like 2 hours of recreational internet per day.
