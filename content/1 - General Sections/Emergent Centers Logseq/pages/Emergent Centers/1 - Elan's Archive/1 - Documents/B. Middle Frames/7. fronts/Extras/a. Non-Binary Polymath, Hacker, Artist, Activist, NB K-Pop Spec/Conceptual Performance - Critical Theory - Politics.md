Perform a series of principles

1. Primary relation and [minimum reality unit] between all things is [[Antinomy]].
2. All things tend towards net negentropy system states and ecologies drawn by an [[[Autodidactic]] [[Universal Attractor]]].

	- Rough analogue - 5 Degrees of Freedom.
	- Assembly Indice, Ports of Connectivity, Degrees of Freedom, Modularity Threshfolds, [[Statistical Mechanics]], [[Radical Emergence]], [[Adjacent Possibilities]], Inferentialism, Photongraphs.
	- [[Intercity Planetary]] Assembly Indice. 15th Century Eurasia + Afro-Asia + Asiamerindia = Amasia.
	  3. Net negentropy is driven by slight differences in information which produce massive [[non-linear]] pay-offs.
	  4. [[State Space AI]] AI
	  5. [[Quantum Commons]] Protocol, Critical Capital.
	  6. There is nobody who is not Amasian.
	  7. Anti-neoliberal liberals, Postwork Republic
	  8. Physical needs before psychological needs.

	  5 Points to change my mind on [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Bestideas.lol]] .
	  1. There is nobody and no entity on Earth, past, present and possible who is not Amasiandigenous.
	  2. There is no info or matter that is not made of quantum photons which transform at varying frequencies towards net negentropy.
	  3. A Post-Work Republic is the best form of society based on an [[Intercity Planetary]] [[Assembly Index]].
	  4. The minimal conditions are .80 gini coefficient, carbon neutrality, contribution to planetary convos. Arbitration involving this can and should be simulated via artistic projects until [[polymath]] literacy is widely distributed.
	  5. The base unit of all possible relations and entities is an [[Antinomy]].
