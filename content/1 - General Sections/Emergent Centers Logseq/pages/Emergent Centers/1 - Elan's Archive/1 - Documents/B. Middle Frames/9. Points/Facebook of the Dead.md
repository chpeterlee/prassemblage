Excerpt from Facebook of the Dead, written by [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/1 - Elan's Archive/1 - Documents/B. Middle Frames/10. Nitty Gritty/Shi the Dragon King]]  of the Eternal Return:

"First the culture will change
Then the commerce
Then the sciences
Then the philosophy
Then the planetary infrastructure

Those of you who have survived and thrived in the shadows of the Dark Oughts
Protected by the Dark Knights and Dark Templars, Dark Enlightenment

Will now pass through the Light
and back again
to melt into the Postwork Markets and magicks

And ye shall be known
as the greywalkers." [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/1 - Elan's Archive/1 - Documents/B. Middle Frames/10. Nitty Gritty/Shi the Dragon King]] , 2022
