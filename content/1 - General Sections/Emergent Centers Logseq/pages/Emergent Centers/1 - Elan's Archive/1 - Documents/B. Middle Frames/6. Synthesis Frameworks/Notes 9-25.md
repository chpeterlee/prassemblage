Upcoming:

1. A mathematical proof connecting lack of education balancing both Humanities and STEM with incompetence, inability to invent ethical solutions to today's ecosocial crises and youth suicide.

2. An articulation of the root of this problem in the neoliberal budgets and policies of Reagan and Thatcher's in the 1980's which cut education budgets by more than 50%, removed social protections and strategically concentrated wealth into a few corporations.

3. A mathematical proof that the only possible way out of the ecosocial crises today is to fund individuals, groups, projects, technologies and legal actions that can verifiably produce solutions - which can then create an exponential growth of aid, self-organization and literacy for human populations.

Corporations & the 1% owe the government; the government and your institutions owe you; ask them for what you're legally owed - education, social protections and wealth redistribution.

Public services and social protections are not the responsibility of your family, friends and neighbors.

Education, social protections and wealth redistribution are the job of your government and social institutions. They are literally paid salary to give you these services.

If you ask them, demand them and negotiate, they are legally bound to give them to you.

If you ask friends, family and neighbors, they are not. And it is incorrect to level a moral judgement upon them for not giving you what your corporations and governments owe you. 

If an individual provides public services to you, either pay them the fair market rate for the quality rendered, or trade something back, even if it's in the form of an I.O.U. or a poem or an artwork.

What is the responsibility of your friends, family and neighbors is to provide proxy legal support for accurate distributions of public services such as education, social protections and wealth redistribution, nothing more or less.

That's the social contract in modern republics. The Catch-22? Most modern republics have been so devastated by education budget cuts, social protection budget cuts and a deregulation of markets, and a propagation of inaccurate mythos of both the power of institutions and the magic of blind grass-roots efforts basically funnels people into 1 or 2 dead ends.

# Next Move:
# 1. Marriage to Art Star & [[Autodidactic]] [[Universal Attractor]]
## 2. Honeymoon at the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]] (Metrics)
## 3. Divorce From Neoliberalism (Queer Lawsuits, Queer Hacking, )
## Problem:
- Physical workers hate learning.
- Information workers have zero skills or work capacity.
- Those able to win the game are exhausted by communicating with the undereducated and underskilled.
## Solution:
1. Streets = legal mass, proxy rights and non-lethal sabotage.
2. Middle class introverts = conversational stream games. Middle class extroverts = proxy credit and blacklists. Aggregated via media.
3. Automated lawsuit games.
##### Upcoming artwork by Antifragile Agent P. Roxy: "Paying One Gen X Nihilist Artist to Not Make A Conceptual Artwork Because They Objectively Have No Good Ideas for 2022, Thus, Making an Actually Good Conceptual Artwork By Constructing an Absence of Gen X Nihilist Art. Seriously, I Will Pay You to Not Make Mediocre Art."










Omg this is the answer: pay people not for producing good information (there's only 10,000 people on Earth who can do so) - pay people for not producing stupid information! And doing stupid things!








 $10,000 Art Competition: Who actually has verifiable solutions to the ecosocial crises, and is not simply just playing childish games of "awareness". Seriously, bro, is there a 7 year old who is not aware of the planet's impending collapse? Find me a kid who didn't hear about the pandemic and saw the absolute incompetence, inaccuracy and incapacity of both the Left and the Right, due to 1980's education budget cuts, social protections removal, and market deregulation. Find me that kid, and I'll find you a Gen X/Gen Z nihilist artist who actually reads. 

T-shirt to make: "Yo Gen X/Gen Z Nihilist Artist, do you read, bro?"
Or
"If you're stupid and you know it, clap your hands over your mouth."
# "Give Stupid People Education, Social Protections and Market Regulations, Not Cultural Platforms",


Operation killiteracy subverts Gen X Nihilists






What is the actual relevant difference in humans today? It's not access or resources - both of those can be hacked and scammed up, non-violently. It is skill with the planet's infrastructure. There's only about 10,000 [[polymath]]s alive on Earth today who can fix it. Give anyone outside that group that job, the planet dies. There is no existing capacity in the government, military or academy. Your favorite contemporary artist, public intellectual faux conceptual pop star will get the planet killed. Who is who is easily testable via experience and exam. Individuals can be of any ethnicity, sex, class, religion, etc., but they will all answer ontological and ethical questions in an objectively correct manner.
# Upcoming: "I Hate the 90's", or destroying the 90's using its own aesthetics.
# Upcoming mathematical proof: without lawsuits and hacking, the planet collapses and over 60 million children die of preventable poverty in the next 10 years.
# Prototype offer for Gen X: 
Gen X, we can save the planet with or without you üñï; you cannot save the planet with your inaccuracy, incapacity and incompetence üö´. 

However, without working together, saving the planet will take longer and hence more children will die in the process so we both lose and will probably end up more insane than the parents üßì you are trying to escape.

If you slow us down, and cause more childrens' death ‚ò†Ô∏è with your stupid/toxic ‚ò£Ô∏è bullshit, you will be blacklisted üì≤. 

There's no time to re-educate your insanely traumatized ass üò≠, so swim in your lane üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, we hack, invent, [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]nk and sue, üêá, we team up ü§ù to save the planet and the least children die üëº. If you want healing üíñ, buy our shrooms and Popular Speculative Art üçÑ.

## 5G shift in strategy: instead of teaching ones who don't know, simply connect the ones who do or can learn! Screw "change", that can be done via automated hacking and lawsuits, I'd much rather just hang out with cool weird people!

#### Why do mainstream Gen X & Gen Z be postmodern nihilist Leftists and Fascists like that, yo? (Underground Gen X/Z are cool tho)
1. The core event creating both mainstream Gen X and Gen Z was the 1980's Reagan and Thatcher budget cuts and policies which did 3 things:
	- Gut cultural and education budgets.
	- Remove social protections legally and financially.
	- Gut regulatory law and systems to concentrate wealth in a few corporations.
	  2. Hence much of mainstream Gen X and Z is undereducated, undersocialized and underresourced. They have 3 main behaviors:
	- Inaccuracy with knowledge
	- Incompetence with tools
	- Incapacity of imaginative action
	  3. Counterattack strategy:
	- Accurately frame the problems on the 1% and corporations. Sue and hack them as art sculptures and fashion.
	- Spread both technical and critical literacy via young adult games and fiction with cute animals.
	- Make an ongoing film of teaming up with and healing the underground Gen X/Z who are cool. Reframe [[Antifragility]] as a superpower.
	  4. Problems
- Linearity
- Binaries
- No statistical accuracy
  5. Solutions
- nonbinary
- Nonlinear
- AI

##### The Proxy Reason Prenuptial Contract and Social practice Performance:
When one of us does or says something inaccurate, incompetent or incapacitating, we are subject to 3 things:
1. Correction via the proportional amount of force.
2. Our claim to reason and legitimate action is rescinded in proportion with our error and potential damage to others.
3. A proxy is given the right to reason and act in our stead, in a proportional capacity necessary to produce net negentropy, according to the 5 degrees of freedom, verifiable by 3rd party physicists and philosophers in 7 dimensions of accuracy.
