# Critical Capital Quarterly Report Outline:
#### 1. How the 1980's cultural and education budget cuts, social protections removal, and wealth concentration created all the problems you and everyone you know has right now, to such a degree that you can't even articulate it accurately - which is exactly why you are owed so much. From the 1% and your institutions. Not your friends, family and neighborhoods. The 1% and your institutions owe you.
#### 2. What a planetful of post-work republics and balanced, cosmo-political, weird and chill humans are supposed to be functionally capable of if the murderous stupidity of the 1980's didn't happen.
#### 3. The statistical proof that [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Antifragile Agency]] and its network is one of the few existing organizations able to provide verifiably positive transformations in your region.
#### 4. Low cost, critical, playful frameworks of participation where you engage flexibly at your own pace while being on the right side of history. You will both be paid fairly and trigger dopamine hits inside you without the alienation of capitalism and the toxicity of poisonous drugs.
#### 5. Robust metrics, short, mid and long term frameworks for a road map for a queer hacker game to build lawsuits to stop planetary collapse and end 10,000 children dying of preventable poverty per day.
# Next move: suing your corporations into giving you what they owe you, and what everyone in your institutions are paid full time to distribute to you, yo.
