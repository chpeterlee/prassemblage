-   A notion of sculpture based on Timothy Morton's concept of the [[[[Hyperobject]]]], which is an object comprised of inferential links across time, space and other materials.
-   The [[[[Hyperobject]]]] has similar connotations as [[hypertext]] and [[hyperlinks]], the foundation of the [[bilinking]] system which this graph database uses.
-   The concept of the [[Hypersculpture]] can also recontextualize:
    -   [[Sol Lewitt]]'s instructional drawings, [[Yoko Ono]]'s poems, [[Fluxus]] based conceptual work, along with media and performance-based works from the late 90's and early 2000's such as [[Yes Men]] and [[Floating Lab Collective]] amongst others.
    -   [[Hypersculpture]] can be used to also materially ground long-standing conceptual art [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]ctices such as [[Duchamp]]'s appropriative methods, along with various conceptual photographic and conceptual video art [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]ctices - and even conceptual painting and drawing [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]ctices such as [[De Kooning]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Cy Twombly]].
