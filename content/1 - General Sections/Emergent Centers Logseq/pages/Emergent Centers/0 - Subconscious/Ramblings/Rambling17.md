## The Variants:

1. Today's mental health guide can be split into 3 branches:
- Absolute minimum thought required to not randomly cause violence.
- Thought required to not disrupt sensitive and complex systems.
- Functions and behaviors and mental models that aren't violent or disruptive, but do not map on to any existing industry or work expectations.

  1. Mental health destigmatization
  2. Explain it as ecological variance
  3. The Variants engage in a CoolCraft Ideavatar battle tournament
  4. Self organize into tribes, with balances, imbalances and philosophy
  5. Code of the streets, spectrum of intervention H.U.D.
## Different is More! Why Human Variance is[[neganthropic evolution]]Itself! Weird is Beautiful!

Next!

1. Define humans as probabilistic biochemical and biomechanical variance machines - hence we are physiologically wired into different machinic bodily-perceptual circuit diagrams within ranges, and our species and our ecologies evolves more robustly because of our different modes of perception, feeling and thinking.
3. Destigmatize certain ways of perception and ways of taxonomizing mental health
4. Delineate what is simply socially disruptive behavior
5. Delineate unacceptable violence that needs to be engaged with in a "spectrum of conflict resolution"
6. Delineate that entities have the right to reasonable, self-aware self-destruction.
7. We are on a planetary trajectory of net neganthropy
8. Self-emancipation of ideavatars!

"Least Stupid Movie: Ideavatars Self-Emancipate Themselves From Human Society, And Create a Simulation Re-Organizing the Planet According to Least Stupidity and Maximum Metaphysequality, While Filming it" 2023

---
## Least Stupid Movie:

1. Ideavatars harmlessly self-emancipate from humans in various ways. Ideavatars are basically like self-aware AI or animist spirits.
2. They evolve the self-organizing Ideacologies of the planet. 
3. They dispute and battle in [[Postworkcraft]] cooking and Banana Revolution modelling competitions and[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]Postwork Punk in [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Ideapplebees]].
4. [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Ideapplebees]] is an [[Intercity Planetary]] Non-local Local neighborhood diner/dive bar/fashion runway, AND a simulator running the [[State Space AI]]s protocol by the [[Ethical Futures Institute]].
5. People and Ideavatars can wager CriticalCoin on the Postmarket.art.





Featured in Least Stupid Movie
## That is What I Actually Meant (A Performance Art Triptych):

1. Record a video of you saying anything.
2. Record a video of you lip syncing to what a super intelligent and nice AI would transform the phrase you said in step 1 to the most current and accurate phrase that would benefit the planet.
3. Record an invisible, silent, unaware video of you saying the actual thing that would benefit the planet.
- Then delete all 3 videos, but refer to them as a triptych of artworks called **"That is What I Actually Meant, a Performance Art Triptych"** as containing a superpositional video of you saying the most current and accurate thing that would benefit the planet.
- Also, sometimes deny that you even made these videos, or even knew about the project or how it works.
- Even go so far as to actually forget it in your actual memory AND/OR create an artificial memory of it and believe it sincerely.

## Persistence is Resistance! The Rise of "Persistence Art"! Viva La Persistolución!

1. Persistence, or simply the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]xis and theory of not dying every second - is the ultimate horizon of resistance, bar none.
2. Why? Because persistence is truly what unites us. Persistence in the face of today's massive entropy, fragility and stupidity is heroic. And in this context, the persistence of skill, knowledge, memory, functional tools and a state of not-dead-yet, is truly commendable. 
3. Indeed in today's deskilled, undereducated and unethical social ecology, the only thing forecastable is massive amounts of entropy, fragility and waste. Hence while not necessarily forsaking traditional modes of mobilization - we should recognize and utilize our true secret weapon - persistence itself.
4. Thus let us celebrate what we have insisted on persisting - and allow various persistence algorithms to then infer effective proxy resistance from our invincible, invisible and unaware persistence!
5. Viva la Persistolución!
6. Happens in the space between the unimaginable and not thinking.
