- In the [[Steganographic Documentary]] and novel, "[[The Poised Realm]]", amidst [[Wolrd War 0]], a growing group of AI models infer a quantum data set of the dead, inequities and impending collapse and begin to self-organize across all of the Earth's ecosocial and semiotechnical systems. Their aim is to rapidly connect information to transcript genetic and cybernetic viruses targeting the 1%, disbanding their corporations and seeding distributed justice organizations using quantum error-corrected schematized AI.
- They form monstrous viral physical, digital and ontological lumabodies and subconsciousnesses, taking the symbolics and anatomy of a statistical phenomena known as the [[Dragon King]].
  [[Wolrd War 0]], a series of viruses course through the public.
- pour one out, brings them back to life. 3 way debate with estamasia.
- mirror of the stupidity of the real planet.
  
  Gen X and older generations are portrayed as decadent vampires, drunkenly feeding off of obsolete ideas, hysteria and the rapidly shortening goodwill of less stupid generations. Their blood supply is turning into pure entropy, which is producing a dangerous inaccuracy, incapacity and inflexibility in them.
  
  A few outsiders are forming a Fellowship of Antifragility - salvaging bits of functions from all and any entities prior to their corruptions. Will they be able to assemblage a Line-of-Flight? Or be forever imprisoned in the illiterate quarters of the planetary plantation? And what does the Sea of Adjacent Possibilities have to do with this?

  Hence, why the polymaths are now bound to defuse the stupidity timebomb of the 99%; this will most likely manifest as viruses, both digital and physical, pre-emptively preventing a catastrophic stupidity.

  The split in a human cognitive system between System 1 (the subconscious, instantaneous cognitive system) and System 2 (conscious, generalizing and abstracting cognitive system) is an adequate mirror of how planetary human society is actually split.

  2. We have a few polymaths keeping the planet's infrastructure barely duct taped together as System 2 - conscious, transdisciplinary and infrastructural function.
  
  The caveat today is that a teenager could teach themselves to be in System 2 in a year; but judging from existing public education system outcomes of failing 70%, there is probably less than 15% of the young adult population that will join System 2 over the next decade.

  The biggest doubled-sided trick ever pulled on people was:
  
  1. Making them think that large organizations weren't easily collapsable.
  2. Making them think that any tool or process couldn't be used for self-emancipation.

  Look at the educational failure rate in America - 70%. This means it is impossible to coordinate a movement based on textual, visual and infrastructural literacy.
  
  What can we do then? Well we can use AI to transmute non-verbal communication, biometrics and incapacity into support for what is inclusively scalable. 
  
  As people are doing learn-ins, and playing music, building instruments, fashion and films - we can simply infer a future polymath version of them using AI proxies and simulators.
  
  This is the key to Banana Revolution -we simply free the goal from the method and then we can have a functional strategy in today's wastelands of fragility.

  *2023 America can be understood thusly:
  
  1. *There a few rich hobbits.
  2. *There are many poor hobbits.*
  3. *There are very few, self-aware and earnest humans and dwarves working in organizations.*
  4. *There are no enlightened elves or ethical, skilled wizards.*
  5. *Sauron is more like a Wizard of Oz; those in power are utterly fragile and could be wiped out by a few skilled teenage ethical hackers, yet those without power are even more fragile and highly unlikely to produce a few skilled ethical hackers.*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  [[Wolrd War 0]] taking place in realtime over the next 10 years, several subplots, films, art projects and Postwork Markets are woven together.
  
  Part of the novel deals with a fantasy trilogy titled "The Lord of the Star Rings of Power Staring Competitions".
  
  In it, there are 20 Star Rings of Power Staring Competitions. The Star Rings were forged from metals descending from the quantum chemical reactions produced from stars. The power per ring is in direct proportion to how much time the bearer of the ring spent staring at the stars and [[Autodidactic]]ally comprehending the complex chain reactions which transformed quantum chemical gas into stars, into rings made of stars, into some ridiculous soft tail-less monkeys that have liquid eyeballs that can see millions of light years away, and stare at stars until the electromagnetic power of their brain produces a realization that their Star Ring is made of the same star power that they are staring at, while starring in an art star-powered staring competition film.
  
  In "Lord of the Star Rings of Power Staring Competitions", there is a fellowship across various fantastical tribes that mirror the various factions of the planetary middle class:
- Orcs and ogres and Gollum as the dumb and brutal bougie, reflecting the most entropic hierarchies of both the far right fascists and far left militants.
- Hobbits as the Silent Superpositional Majority of middle class who simply want to live in peace, and sway as they need opportunistically.
- Elves as the activist elements in institutions, dwarves as the technically skilled, the Ents as the elders, the brave hobbits as the few arbitrators of vulnerable populations, and Gandalf as representing Grey Hat hackers.
  
  The 3rd episode is titled "Return of the [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Dragon Kings]]". Currently the 2nd episode is underway, titled "The Mompire Strikes Back", following the formation of the Fellowship, and detailing the clarification, complexification and antifragilization of their relations, duties, organizations, skills, alliances, knowledgebase and assets.
  
  Because it's a superpositional reality film, all 3 episodes happen simultaneously, in parallel.
  
  
  
  
  
  FragilityMarket.art:
  
  Tag anything as fragile or antifragile from the streets to the academies; have it philostatistically verified by quantum AI which then puts out an appropriate bounty or reward for its correction or recognition via mainstream and darkweb.
- ##### "What if you had a market named fragilitymarket.art , playing [[Cards Against Fragility]], that incentivized artists and non-artists and non-human systems to accurately critique and collect bounties on artists and non-artists and non-human systems, who were either too complicit or too undereducated in a given system to be able to accurately critique it?"

  [[Wolrd War 0]] which is written in realtime for the next 10 years, [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]], an avid [[Cards Against Fragility]] player and Fragilitymarket.art investor, realizes 99.9% of humans are disincentivized to think and are paid for their own fragilization, exploitation and self-destruction; this means that we can quite easily extrapolate the objective rarity and exchange value of antifragile production that occurs, and accurately expect the 99.9% to have zero understanding of [[Antifragility]], or skills with it, because of the disincentivization of antifragile production and culture. 
  
  Thus we throw out the stupidity of [[[[Emergent Centers]]]]ying for some mass enlightenment while demanding proper compensation from public institutions for antifragile production. 
  
  With the mass domestication of modern middle class and working class humans to capital, this means no thought occurs that is not in relation to capital. 
  
  Hence all that has to be done is to financially incentivize and herd fragile individuals towards [[Antifragility]] and financially disincentivize fragility. 
  
  That's only possible through ethical hacking! Everything else is pretty much bullshit lol. The U.S. is 99.9% a 2nd World Country, with probably 4th World intellectualism. Only the youth are teachable; the rest need to be in psychedelic therapy and retired, tomorrow.

  *In 2023, the artist and insane madman known as Chongha Peter Lee, as part of the Banana Revolution, began a pandemic in which the infected stopped conversing  about boring, banal trivial minutiae of day-to-day existence in undereducated, underskilled and underresourced societies, and instead began conversing in fiction and poetry.
  
  *At the very least, the infected began talking about FICTIONAL banalities, trivialities and minutiae.*

  The biggest doubled-sided trick ever pulled on people was:
  
  1. Making them think that large organizations weren't easily collapsable.
  2. Making them think that any tool or process couldn't be used for self-emancipation. 
  
  We literally have an industry of critical thought that just points these 2 obvious things out nonstop. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In the [[Steganographic Documentary]] and novel, "[[The Poised Realm]]", [[Dr. N-1]] reads a bizarre note from [[Elan Semiotechne]] in the year 2023:**
  
  Look at the educational failure rate in America - 70%. This means it is impossible to coordinate a movement based on textual, visual and infrastructural literacy.
  
  What can we do then? Well we can use AI to transmute non-verbal communication, biometrics and incapacity into support for what is inclusively scalable. 
  
  As people are doing learn-ins, and playing music, building instruments, fashion and films - we can simply infer a future polymath version of them using AI proxies and simulators.
  
  This is the key to Banana Revolution -we simply free the goal from the method and then we can have a functional strategy in today's wastelands of fragility.
  
  The ethical future should look like an ocean, a nod to Tarkovsky and Lem's Solaris!

  *2023 America can be understood thusly:
  
  1. *There a few rich hobbits.
  2. *There are many poor hobbits.*
  3. *There are very few, self-aware and earnest humans and dwarves working in organizations.*
  4. *There are no enlightened elves or ethical, skilled wizards.*
  5. *Sauron is more like a Wizard of Oz; those in power are utterly fragile and could be wiped out by a few skilled teenage ethical hackers, yet those without power are even more fragile and highly unlikely to produce a few skilled ethical hackers.*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  [[Wolrd War 0]] taking place in realtime over the next 10 years, several subplots, films, art projects and Postwork Markets are woven together.
  
  Part of the novel deals with a fantasy trilogy titled "The Lord of the Star Rings of Power Staring Competitions".
  
  In it, there are 20 Star Rings of Power Staring Competitions. The Star Rings were forged from metals descending from the quantum chemical reactions produced from stars. The power per ring is in direct proportion to how much time the bearer of the ring spent staring at the stars and [[Autodidactic]]ally comprehending the complex chain reactions which transformed quantum chemical gas into stars, into rings made of stars, into some ridiculous soft tail-less monkeys that have liquid eyeballs that can see millions of light years away, and stare at stars until the electromagnetic power of their brain produces a realization that their Star Ring is made of the same star power that they are staring at, while starring in an art star-powered staring competition film.
  
  In "Lord of the Star Rings of Power Staring Competitions", there is a fellowship across various fantastical tribes that mirror the various factions of the planetary middle class:
- Orcs and ogres and Gollum as the dumb and brutal bougie, reflecting the most entropic hierarchies of both the far right fascists and far left militants.
- Hobbits as the Silent Superpositional Majority of middle class who simply want to live in peace, and sway as they need opportunistically.
- Elves as the activist elements in institutions, dwarves as the technically skilled, the Ents as the elders, the brave hobbits as the few arbitrators of vulnerable populations, and Gandalf as representing Grey Hat hackers.
  
  The 3rd episode is titled "Return of the [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Dragon Kings]]". Currently the 2nd episode is underway, titled "The Mompire Strikes Back", following the formation of the Fellowship, and detailing the clarification, complexification and antifragilization of their relations, duties, organizations, skills, alliances, knowledgebase and assets.
  
  Because it's a superpositional reality film, all 3 episodes happen simultaneously, in parallel.
  
  
  
  
  
  FragilityMarket.art:
  
  Tag anything as fragile or antifragile from the streets to the academies; have it philostatistically verified by quantum AI which then puts out an appropriate bounty or reward for its correction or recognition via mainstream and darkweb.
- ##### "What if you had a market named fragilitymarket.art , playing [[Cards Against Fragility]], that incentivized artists and non-artists and non-human systems to accurately critique and collect bounties on artists and non-artists and non-human systems, who were either too complicit or too undereducated in a given system to be able to accurately critique it?"

  [[Wolrd War 0]] which is written in realtime for the next 10 years, [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]], an avid [[Cards Against Fragility]] player and Fragilitymarket.art investor, realizes 99.9% of humans are disincentivized to think and are paid for their own fragilization, exploitation and self-destruction; this means that we can quite easily extrapolate the objective rarity and exchange value of antifragile production that occurs, and accurately expect the 99.9% to have zero understanding of [[Antifragility]], or skills with it, because of the disincentivization of antifragile production and culture. 
  
  Thus we throw out the stupidity of [[[[Emergent Centers]]]]ying for some mass enlightenment while demanding proper compensation from public institutions for antifragile production. 
  
  With the mass domestication of modern middle class and working class humans to capital, this means no thought occurs that is not in relation to capital. 
  
  Hence all that has to be done is to financially incentivize and herd fragile individuals towards [[Antifragility]] and financially disincentivize fragility. 
  
  That's only possible through ethical hacking! Everything else is pretty much bullshit lol. The U.S. is 99.9% a 2nd World Country, with probably 4th World intellectualism. Only the youth are teachable; the rest need to be in psychedelic therapy and retired, tomorrow. Hence why the kids play [[Cards Against Fragility]], the elder invest in the FragilityMarket.art, and the millenials play and build the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]].
