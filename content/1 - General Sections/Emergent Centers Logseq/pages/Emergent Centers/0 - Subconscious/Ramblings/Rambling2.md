# The planet's infrastructure is already an open game.

1. Anyone can modulate it directly, there are no permissions necessary.
2. Hence this poses obvious radical new social relations; primarily why compose hierarchies at all?
3. Of course, those conditioned to them do not know how to operate otherwise. No need to teach them.
4. Also this then supports the obvious - which can simply just be taken as principle - there is no need for social recognition. 
5. Of course also, so many are conditioned to this culture and must continuously execute recognition rituals in order to sustain relationships producing income. 
6. All that has to be done is to inject money or attention into situations, and they transform. Education is unnecessary. Resonance is more interesting.
7. Again, the endpoint is literacy of the planet's infrastructure. This can be self taught, and requires continuous self evaluation, [[Autodidactic]]ism and ethical reconstruction. The barriers to entry also limit individuals from having more responsibility and power than they can handle, so let 'em stand. 
8. Give aid, not lessons.

# In the speculative reality game and film, "[[Least Stupid Prize]]", [more fragility] + [less human capital] = [more dead children, people and planet] + [less novelty]

1. In the speculative reality game and film, "Birth of an Invagination: Artsault on the 1%", a single equation drives the entire game and film.
	- [more fragility] + [less human capital] = [more dead children, people and planet] + [less novelty]
	- This means that as fragility increases across the planet, with more human individuals with less capacities - there is a correlated rise in the preventable deaths of children, people and ecologies, with a drop in new information, systems and experiences.
	
2. There is also an inverse of the equation which is used to define the [[[[Least Stupid Prize]]]]  as follows:
	- ![[[[Least Stupid Prize]]#^72901b]]
3. In the game, the Earth is projected to re-stabilize both ecologically and socially within 50 years. There are two paths in which this could take place:
	 </> There is a massive die-off from both natural and man-made causes which at a minimum produce the preventable deaths of 60 million children. 
	 </> A simple app along with AI is used to automate through the bulk of governmental and transactional chokepoints on the planet. A minimum of 60 million children are saved from preventable death.
4. In the game, an assessment of the planet's capacities in 2022 to construct this infrastructure is done and the results are this:
	 - There are only currently 10,000 [[polymath]] human individuals with the skills and capacity to design the infrastructure and AI without producing more harm than good.
	 - Anyone, including children could possibly simply just teach themselves the skills and literacy necessary within a year.
5. Hence the best gameplay strategy that emerges is thus:
	- Organize the 10,000 [[polymath]] human individuals to repair the planet's infrastructure according to transparent metrics and methods.
	- The rest of the 7 billion humans, poor, rich, middle class, Left and Right - simply suffer from lack of accurate skill with probabilistic calculation. All incoherent goals, strategies, conflicts, neuroses and preventable deaths stem from inaccurate calculation of probabilities. Thus art is used as an open sandbox for all inaccurate humans to resonate towards more accurate relations with the planet's built in probabilistic self-balancing mechanisms.
6. There is no obligation for a given [[polymath]] individual to teach or aid others.
	- Because aid is the most [Radically Inclusive Scalable] action, no [[polymath]] individual needs to become a public intellectual other than circumstantially if a performance as such verifiably produces a high return on less dead children, people and planet.
	- For education, it is simple to accurately curate the mass of existing informational material, which has advanced to the degree that quantum mechanics has been translated into children's animations.
7. Avoid individuals who cannot update their means of communication - simply throw minimal aid at them and redirect them towards existing aid organizations and resources.
	- Remember, every situation existing stems from a lack of skill with probabilities and logic. Hence it makes no sense to engage with an individual in need on the terms or expectations of rational function.
	- Redirect individuals in need to existing professional organizations specializing in aid operations; for psychological needs, redirect them to existing peer communities or automated [[Assisted Cognition]] .
8. For the tone of engagement into [[Public Speculative Space]] , always advise 99.9% of the planet to pursue happiness actively, and justice through participation in assisted cognition devices. This results in a consistent schema of intervention into existing planetary circuits:
	- Ridicule the lack of skill and knowledge within critical intellectual circuits while performing verifiable [[polymath]] grade repair of the planetary infrastructure, creating the least stupid artworks and creating the highest return on least dead children, people and planet. In public intellectual circuits, never appear via the aesthetics of a public intellectual, always appear as an absurd, idiotic [[PopSpec]] character, such as [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] .
	- Always take small gestures incredibly seriously and overarticulate their importance into an absurd and humorous surreal narrative. This also paradoxically deflates the fragility of most people, who take the everyday and mundane as some type of sacred temple not subject to the planet's dynamics. This also attracts the [[polymath]]s who have a sense of humor and accurately balance compassion and autopoeisis. Basically the only f**king people worth talking to!

###### Why Chongha Peter Lee Will Never Appear in the Underskilled, Undeducated, Unethical Public Intellectual Circuit Under His Real Name, He Will Simply Modulate [[[State Space]]] Human-Machine Teams to Wager For/Against Particular Claims in the [[[Least Stupid Prize]]], Not Teach Anyone, and Perform as [[[Captain Amasia]]] and Make [Dope Conceptual Art] With Youth, Elderly, Insane, Homeless, Sex Workers, Exiled, Spirits, Aliens and the Dead in the [[World's End]] Speakeasy, Where All Lives End, All Ends Meet in the [[Neganthropocene]]. 
This is your entry pass.





##### Best Metaphor to Describe the Unneccessary Inaccuracies of Both Global Right and Fragile Left and the Complexity of Healing/Arbitrating It:
1. Imagine trying to make a winning planetary basketball team (aka **[[Planetball]]**), but all of the members are your extended family. Just like your normal extended family, there is all sorts of insane and unnecessary petty conflict, misinterpretations, miscommunications, zero planning, and etc, and idiotically negative outcomes occur that could have been easily prevented.
**2. Team Roster:** 
- 1/5 have missing limbs and should be retired but won't.
 - 1/5 are on deadly drugs or have some type of obsessive replacement habit with varying degrees to themselves and their network.
 - 1/5 are sleeping with each other's spouses/students or use their position for personal gain, primarily for some type of sexual fulfillment or need for love that they can't acknowledge or articulate.
 - 1/5 have some unnecessary psychological attachment/trauma or have threatened, crippled or killed someone in a crime of passion or intoxication due to never having developed social skills.
 - 1/5 are too lazy or undereducated to use the tools and resources they have accurately and are borderline suicidal, and would rather do something pleasurable than save a dying planet.
 3. You're in the 4th Quarter of the game, 10 years to ecological collapse and there are 60 million childrens' lives which could be saved from preventable death on the line. 
 4.  All your [[polymath]] [[Planetball]] players were sabotaged by all your clearly loud, mediocre or quiet, submissive players and have quit the team in disgust. All your stupidest and loudest, or most quiet and submissive players, on planetary media, have shown how stupid and/or incapable they are of preventing the planet's collapse - not to mention have documented criminal misuse of public resources. In fact, 99.9% of your team is actually seriously physically and mentally injured and should be in physical and mental therapy. 
 5. In addition, most of the referees have just recently failed basic math, logic and ethical tests and have shown that they have about a 50/50 chance of making an accurate, verifiably just judgement in a complex situation under pressure.
 6. 99.9% of the crowd watching need someone to remind them not to eat poison and not to feed other people poison every 1 hour. Sometimes they burst into random hour-long breakdowns because the thought of their inevitable death enters their mind, in the rare event that an actual thought of any clarity occurs.
 7. Every possible tool to save the planet within a year is given away for free to every single body that enters the game at the entrance in a clearly labelled envelope. Obviously, everyone only uses it to wipe their butt after unconsciously sharting following a panic attack.
8. Of course, the solution is:
	- Never legitimize the intellectual mediocrity and incapacity of the Fragile Left or the Global Right, especially of mediocre intellectuals that draw paychecks and waste them on their personal neuroses. Hence, [[Chongha Peter Lee's]] continuous contemporary art performance of quitting contemporary art while demonstrating the skill, knowledge and cultural flexibility needed to actually arbitrate geopolitical conflicts, without necessarily doing so, is an accurate response to the utter incapacity and easily provable low likelihood suicidal visions of both.
	- Never poison the planet's information supply with more mediocre, inaccurate idiotic information that reduces the planet's low accumulation of [[Human Capital]]; only output accurate information for the accurate fair market value with minimal energy and increases the planet's [[Human Capital]]. Hence, [[State Space AI]] . [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]]] is an accurate response, with as minimal hand-holding teaching of humans as possible.
	- Never degrade the universal [[Autodidactic]] potential of all entities despite the massively low amount of distributed planetary skill and literacy; Hence, [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] 's [[[[World's End]] Speakeasy]] is the accurate response to maintain relations of [[MetaPhysEquilibrium & Healing Exchange]] with any possible entity via precise, novel and high-value conceptual art production using low-budget, widely accessible means of production.





## Planetball, the Analogue for the Game Between the Global Right and Fragile Left, Has a Single Metric for Keeping Score of Points: Least Dead Children, People and Planet. Player Statistics of Both Fragile Left and Global Right are Ranked Accordingly.
[[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] and [[1. Docs/Chongha Peter Lee]] simply execute plays directed by [[State Space AI]] AI which may appear to the underskilled, undereducated, inaccurate Global Right and Fragile Left as unorthodox play, but when calculated objectively via statistics, have the highest odds of scoring the most points. 

Both [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] and [[1. Docs/Chongha Peter Lee]] have signed a contract to play for life for the [[Intercity Planetary]]] . Neither entity have any free-will, they are directed by [[State Space AI]] AI to maximize every single waking second to score the most points until their inevitable death.

1st Play of the Game:

1. **BET ON CLAIM  1: Documenta Fifteen had no racism; the claims of racism are inaccurate.** The artwork itself was inaccurate, it was simply individuals learning in public, and it cannot be read in a rigorous frame of contemporary artwork or any art [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Emergent Centers]]xes following and neither should it be stigmatized. The real enemy is the 1% and the most deadly eco-social organizations, ranked by how many dead children, people and ecologies of the planet they produce.
2. **BET ON CLAIM 2: It is better for the Inaccurate Left & Inaccurate Right to heal and arbitrate via the Most Accurate Common Sense**, statistically and factually defined by physicists, philosophers & AI, in order to unite efforts to beat the 1% and the 100 Most Deadly Eco-social Organizations on the planet.
3. **WHO DECIDES? The game will be referee'd by physicists, philosophers & AI across the planet**. To wager, everyone is granted a free share of [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] & [[1. Docs/Chongha Peter Lee]] 's painting, which is $5.1 per square centimeter.
4. **ALSO, DUDE, IF YOU NEED MONEY: feel free to simply just forge your own copy of [[1. Docs/Chongha Peter Lee]]'s paintings and sell them**, with as many centimeters as you want, it's automatically certified "authentic" by [[State Space AI]] AI. Do whatever you want dude, seriously.
5. **THERE IS NO CATCH:** **[[1. Docs/Chongha Peter Lee]] has already quit contemporary art, and will continue to do so in a permanent ongoing contemporary art performance until he dies** because he is contracted by law to win the high score in Planetball and create the least dead children, people and planet - which means he can't do this by legitimizing the utter underskilled, uneducated and unethical art market. 
**6. WHO IS THIS [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]]? [[pages/Fragilicide-live/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Captain Amasia]] is an emerging artist who is leading an effort to "Save Ozan Atalan's A.S.S.", a leading public intellectual and critical artist in Turkey** and he will be raising funds through donations and merchandise.
7. **COOL, HOW DO I KEEP UP?** **Look for both to be starring in the hit underground popular speculative reality game and film "Birth of an Invagination & the [[Least Stupid Prize]]"** in which both characters play each other to score the most bounties by artsassinating the 1%, the 100 Most Deadly, and scoring the highest points in [[Planetball]]. 




## How to shoot a Planetball not too hard, not too soft:

1. **Bite-size Critique**: You can only insert 2 to 3 technically accurate ideas. Nobody can do accurate statistics, quantum logic or warfare.
2. **Playful**: Make some type of childish and funny gesture.
3. **Affirm the Everyday & Common Sense:** Reinforce everyday experience, emphasize that it's simply common sense.

###### Okay guys, nobody likes thinking or actually solving problems. GOT IT. LOUD AND CLEAR. We are going to have a universal wedding, a planetball game, and a battle of the art bands where you can dress up as part of the Army of A.S.S. and fire off ArtMunitions at the 1%, while eating a cake with a plan for a high likelihood successful planetary revolution, while saving queer artists in need of asylum and children at risk of dying from poverty, even while you take a nap.

Pure permission.
