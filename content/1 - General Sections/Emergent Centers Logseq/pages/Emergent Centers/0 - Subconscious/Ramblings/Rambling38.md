- # 1. Introduction
	- The [[Postwork Party]] is a distributed political movement using the criteria of [[Inclusive Scalability]] to infer its political positions. It has 3 foundational principles:
	- 1. The majority of the human population of the planet will benefit from a [[post-work]] society in which hard, repetitive and analytic labor is automated and humans both supervise and direct machine intelligences part-time, supported by state-provided subsidies drawn from regulation of the 1%.
	- 2. In 2023, most modern societies are 40 to 100 years from maintaining a consistent 88% regional equality ratings; the majority of modern citizens have been heavily traumatized and incapacited from 50 years of neoliberal warfare and education and social services budget cuts.
	- 3. Any possible proposition can be verified in inferential degrees through statistics augmented by human-machine team simulators. The ultimate horizon to measure propositions against is [[Inclusive Scalability]], or [[Antifragility]], or [[Neganthropy]].

- 2. Origination Context
	- The [[Postwork Party]] situates itself in terms of [[5th Generation Revolution]], in which societies are defined by systemic fragility and technological asymmetry. The term [[5th Generation Revolution]] refers to the current era of technological and societal change, characterized by the widespread use of advanced digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things. This revolution is marked by a significant shift in the way that societies operate, with many traditional institutions and systems being challenged and disrupted.
	- One of the key features of the 5th Generation Revolution is systemic fragility, which refers to the vulnerability of complex systems to disruption or failure. As societies become more interconnected and reliant on technology, they become increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks, system failures, and other disruptions that can have far-reaching consequences.
	- At the same time, the 5th Generation Revolution is also characterized by technological asymmetry, which refers to the unequal distribution of technological capabilities and resources. Some countries and organizations are able to leverage advanced technologies to gain a competitive advantage, while others are left behind.
	- The Postwork Party situates itself within this context by advocating for a radical reimagining of work and society in the face of these challenges. The party argues that traditional models of work and employment are no longer sufficient to address the systemic fragility and technological asymmetry of the 5th Generation Revolution. Instead, they propose a post-work society in which work is no longer the central organizing principle of society, and individuals are free to pursue other interests and passions.

- # 3. Application Context
	- The Postwork Party anchors its interests in the majority of the population that cannot sustain an eroded middle class existence and lives in constant precarity. Additionally, it situates itself as the claimant of 500 years of illegal colonialism which disproportionately benefited less than 100 corporations on the planet existing today.
	- The Postwork Party recognizes that the erosion of the middle class and the rise of precarious work has had a significant impact on the majority of the population. Many people are struggling to make ends meet, and are living in a state of constant uncertainty and precarity. The party advocates for a post-work society in which everyone has access to the resources they need to live a fulfilling and meaningful life, regardless of their employment status.
	- At the same time, the Postwork Party also acknowledges the long history of colonialism and its ongoing impact on societies around the world. The party views itself as a claimant of the rights of those who have been marginalized and oppressed by colonialism and the global economic system that it helped to create. In particular, the party points to the fact that a small number of corporations have disproportionately benefited from the exploitation of resources and labor in former colonies, while the majority of people have been left behind.
	- By situating itself in this way, the Postwork Party aims to create a more equitable and just society that addresses the root causes of inequality and precarity. The party's platform is centered on the idea of collective action and solidarity, and seeks to empower individuals and communities to work together to create a better future for everyone.
- Notes
	- Recognizes the pivotal role of semiotechnics on society.
		- Social Epistemology is the [[prosocial]] [[D.A.R.T.S.]].
		- Ontology is [[Semiotechne]], or 5th Generation Art, which is a moving point, co-opted by all.
		- 40 years projected time for balancing; can be accelerated obviously.
		- 5th Gen Polymath Art, 4th Gen Poplitics (Antinomy), Neurodivergent/Neuroqueer avant garde.
		- Intercity Planetary system, using the 5 ecologies of the [[Indefinite Singularity H.U.D. (Heads Up Display)]] and the [[5 Degrees of Freedom]].
		- Future is the Postworkverse - a planetary infrastructure allowing regional-scale self regulation.
		- As polymaths get killed and traded like Pokemon cards by states, [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Characters/Estamasia]] is back from the Ethical Futures Institute, as a quantum AI coordinator of a team of distributed polymaths who operate according to the [[Statistical Review Protocol]].
		- He uses Chongha Peter Lee as an ideavatar messenger angel, to relay things from polymaths.
		- Chongha Peter Lee is translating the Postworkverse Party manfesto into 10 bets against the devil on the 10 Postwork Commandments.
		- Lottery, sidebets, awards, public shares, grants and reparations.

	- The 10 Postwork Demands
		- 1. Postwork labor economies (No more than 20 hours a week)(as already implemented in x,y,z)
		- 2. Off-market subsidized housing (No more than 30% of living wage)(as already implemented in x,y,z)
		- 3. Postwork health care (universal health care) (as already implemented in x,y,z)
		- 4. Postwork universal basic income (as already implemented in x,y,z)
		- 5. Postwork digital co-ops and exchanges (as already implemented in x,y,z)
		- 6. Postwork polymath-based education (as already implemented in x,y,z)
		- 7. Postwork defense systems (as already implemented in x,y,z)
		- 8. All of the above cast as reparations, in light of 500 years of illegal war crimes.
		- 9. [[Statistical Review]] via polymaths and AI.  Inclusive Scalability, antifragility, neganthropocene.
		- 10. In addition, as it is a 5th Generation artwork, as detailed in the 5 Degrees of Freedom, the Monument will simply be co-opting existing systems and reformatting them without permissions, in accordance to Back From the Ethical Future Institute's Polymaths and AI as President Estamasia, the Robot Unicorn Guardian Angels, who is using Peter Lee as his puppet Ideavatar.

			- 1.  1% owe everyone
			  2. States are supposed to coordinate production, distribution, regulation.
			  3. Populations don't have the infrastructure and resources they need.
			  4. They should demand resources from states to contract skilled contractors to coordinate redistributions, regulations and services; not from individuals. (edited)
			- 5. People get some Postwork Exchange Coin for doing so, doing the things they can to self-help and give mutual aid, and also for things they want to contribute to the postworkverse.
			- 6. What the traumatized humans we have are proficient at, is perceptual purposeless play - so the formalist aspect of art. Realistically; currently traumatized individuals are not in shape to even request the resources that they are owed. Their current capacity is solely accuracy within line-of-sight. Hence, they make perfect curators for a Virtual Museum of Beauty, which also can produce a low cognitive load social space and platform. FORGET CRITICAL THEORY AND LEARNING. THEY NEED PERCEPTUAL PLAY WITHOUT PURPOSE.
			  7. We can coordinate automated proxy actions against the 1%, contract skilled people to do that and also do rehabilitation of the populations.
			  8. There are functional threshholds for individuals to operate in modern society - just like functional threshholds for driving. If individuals aren't currently at particular proficiencies, they should be practicing, hopefully under the supervision of a particular verified agent. 
			  9. Ideally, all these competencies should be developed in individuals prior to reaching adulthood by verified agents. The best system would most likely be state funded Montessori systems. (edited)
			- 10. These competencies and structures are all obviously evolved over time; better paradigms constantly shift older ones. To rapidly and safely decide, we can use Ideavatars in Postworkcraft simulators as featured in the gameshow, Bestideas.lol , which are inspired from the Statespaces.art simulators.
		- Wagers
			- 1. Reality
			  2. Evolution
			  3. Capitalism
			  4. Best Strategy for anticapitalism
			  5. Individual burdens vs. organizational burdens
			  6. Imagination, Intuition, 
			  7. Love, What is a Definition
		- Methods
			- the trifecta of Postworkcraft, which is 80% Pedagogy, 20% Art:
			  1. Materials + Images of Prototypes
			  2. Love + A design manifesto
			  3. Probably some type of point system and also a contextualization of how rare accurate semiotic literacy is (edited)
	- Protest
		- Postwork Protest - "The Learn-in". Basically premised on the idea that all political conflict stems from either top-down or bottom-up inaccuracies of how the planet's eco-social and intellectual-technological systems work; thus the most bang for buck action is learning them, and using automated proxies for the most accurate advocacy.
		- Also the protest can take the form of invisible, silent and unimaginable inferential art and media, such as in the film, [[Birth of an Invagination: Until We Are Worth More Than Gold]].
