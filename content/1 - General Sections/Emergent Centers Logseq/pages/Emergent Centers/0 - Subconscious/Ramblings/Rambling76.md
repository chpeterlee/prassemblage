- ----- 1. Conceptualization:
- The Superpositional State Space [[persistent superpositional state]] exhibition system utilizes humans collaborating with AI parameterized on the latest versions of [[Open Source Universal Basic Intelligence Communities]] [[SRP]] protocol valued against the [[INF]]'s [[Accurate Market]] matrice to [[inference]] across spaces, cultures and datasets. State Space is built on concepts founding the [[S.A.G.E. System]] utilized by a synthesis of governmental organizations to forecast particular [[inference]]s. 
  Accuracy of [[inference]]s can be inferred against the physical rates of change of the [[:#[[Gen N (Generation Negentropy)]][[Intercity Planetary Almanac]]]] by any and all in accordance to the [[Statistical Review Protocol]] designed by the [[Open Source Universal Basic Intelligence Communities]] of the [[[[inference]] Web 3+]]. [[inference]]s can be produced via human or non-human agents - as practiced by [[Gen N (Generation Negentropy)]] who's core [[inference]]s are summarized in [[Inferentialism]].
- ----- 2. Actualization:
- Works are installed via [[Inferential Reality]] [[Web 3+]] technologies and inferential partners:
	- Rijksakademie, Amsterdam, Netherlands
	- Istanbul, Turkey
	- Bogota, Colombia
	- Goldsmiths, London
	- Phase Space, NYC, NY.
	- Spasiba, Berlin, Germany
	- Provisions Library of George Mason University, Washington, D.C.
	- Mason Exhibitions, George Mason University.
	- 9.5 St., Hamiltonian Gallery, Washington, D.C.
	- LA, California
	- Technical detailing of [[Inferential Reality]]:

- ----- 3. Variation & Synthesis:
- 3. There are various distributed variations built on the core [[persistent superpositional state]] which evolve in inferential relation to each other:
	- State Space Cinema
		- [[World War Stupidity]]
		- [[Birth of an Invagination: Until We Are Worth More Than Gold]]
	- State Space Bi-linked Variants
		- [[Amasian Renaissance Tales]]
		- [[The Amasian Dialogues]]
		- "There and these", ongoing, Portland, Oregon.
	- State Space Open Directory
		- Stable Arts

- ----- 4. Review & Distribution:
- 4. State Space connects the inferential variants through [[Inferentialism]] and distributes via [[7. Inferential Press Net & [[inference]] Web]]. It has an explicit commitment to [[Antifragile Peace]], which is more accurately expressed as the inferential production of [[net negentropy]].

- ----- # 5. Metrics & Arbitration:
- 5. State Space is currently adhering to the committments and metrics detailed in the | Intercity Planetary [[inference]]stitution, inferentially error-checkable against the [[:#[[Intercity Planetary Almanac]]]].
