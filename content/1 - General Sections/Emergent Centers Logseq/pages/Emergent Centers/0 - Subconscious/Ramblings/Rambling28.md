## 3 Wagers by the [[Ethical Futures Institute]] members:

1. 99% of today's Humanities and Sciencies ecology is too fragile and inflexible to address today's ecosocial problems and produce inclusively scalable solutions. As a result, there will be massive unnecessary death. Low chance possibility solution - resources and attention are re-organized around a few [[polymath]]s who are doing 80% of the work of all the fields already. 

2. The U.S. is 40 years away from organizational flexibility and 100 years away from widespread social stability with an 88% rating of regional equality. The outside chance is a rapid adoption of the proper techno-cultural protocols accurately fit to regional contexts; unfortunately there are very few organizations on Earth that can do this.

3. About 10-15% of today's modern populations' children will grow into [[Autodidactic]], ethical and autonomous individuals; maybe less than 5% will make inclusively scalable contributions to the planet. The best strategy would be to accelerate the few and redistribute resources to the majority, while humanizing them in safe postwork simulation spaces.

How do you know if an individual is a [[polymath]]?

Look at how many different functions they can perform competently, test how many knowledge domains they are accurate in. 

Comparatively they should score higher than 99% of the population in breadth.

That's it! Proof is in the pudding.

[[Ethical Futures Institute]] Advisory to the [[Intercity Planetary]]:

1. The global middle class is objectively too fragile for a rapid social transformation; projected timeline for the stabilization of most societies is 40-100 years.


2. The best strategy in this absolutely fragile 5th Generation revolutionary state would be threefold:
- Produce proxy protests of the Postworking Class, using AI. Unburden them from all cognitive labor from democracy proper; enter them into Montessori re-education programs.
- Absolutely remove all production responsibilities of the middle class through automation as much as possible. Compensate them for supervising automated systems, archives and postwork protocols.
- Contract the few [[polymath]]s on the planet to repair, upgrade and defend the planet's infrastructure.
  
  
  
  
  Postwork Party:
  
  Fragility is a medical condition; the 1% owe the millenials rehab. 
  
  The populace needs to demand the government to contract skilled contractors.
  
  Also, love is how we create transdisciplinarity and post-work non-human relations.
  
  Unimaginability is a test.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  "A 5th Wave Feminist Artwork Doesn't Talk About a Problem, it Solves it Inclusively and Scalably
  
  Talking About Problems Without Any Hope at Solving Them is 4th Wave and Below" 2023
  
  Seriously, it's 2023, why would we just settle for constantly talking about problems everyone is living through? What is this, the 50's?

  AI and avatars are pretty much the only feasible method for rapid, inclusive and scalable social balancing in the 21st Century. It will take 40-100 years to balance the planet.
  
  Most people should forget trying to participate in even a service economy; they should just farm, sell shrooms and go on a road trip to answer the question - "Where is the Love"?
  
  If you're not a [[polymath]] and you are allergic to thought, which most humans traumatized and stunted by neoliberalism are - just hit the road! With shrooms!

  [[Postworkcraft]] Minigame: 
  
  The world is going to take 40-100 years to be balanced by [[polymath]]s.
  
  If you are not a [[polymath]], and you are allergic to accurate critical thought like most of modern society, get a huge bag of shrooms, your least annoying friends, and go on a road trip.
  
  Here's your driving question: "Where is the Love?"
  
  
  
  
  
  
  "Wager: there are objectively way easier and more accurate solutions to your problems that are unimaginable to you now because you were traumatized and stunted by the 1%, who owe you money for therapy, and who also owe me money for explaining this to you via AI avatar" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

  5th Generation Revolution:
  
  1. The majority of the populace is so utterly decimated by neoliberalism to the point that the idea of solutions are unimaginable; also, states and corporations are utterly fragile because they are drawing their personnel from this population.
  2. The majority of production-distribution-regulation infrastructure is operated by specialists directed by [[polymath]]s; hence obviously, this is where the revolutionary subject would be. [[polymath]]s directing specialists to coordinate populations.
  3. To keep this from turning into another centralized shadowy endeavor, all that would have to be done would be to produce a simple error checking protocol that a child could operate and use; so the internals don't necessarily have to be exposed, just give the non-[[polymath]]s protocols to follow to produce local optimizations and arbitration mechanisms. **(AmasianHaus , [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Ideapplebees]])**
  4. To reduce this labor, AI and avatars can be deployed. Also, media technologies and material-based curriculums can be used. People can be employed for this production.
  5. In addition, automated agents can help error check, fused with traditional cultural figures of autonomous proxies, such as saints, ghosts, angels, demons, spirits and etc.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Through engagement with materials, toys, games and theater, the population can learn. 
  
  This is 80% pedagogy, 20% art.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Canadians are way more educated! Plus they got art dough.
