# "5G Game of Betterideas.art by [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/1 - Elan's Archive/1 - Documents/B. Middle Frames/10. Nitty Gritty/Shi the Dragon King]]  of [[polymath]] Artists of 5G Art:

Also remember that you can just avoid the question of judgement and simply make the planet saving home run instead, and save the planet- because it is objectively possible!

Or you can just party like it's after the end of the world!" 2022
