## Upcoming essay by BearNard Stiegler (the world's first quantumdead bear media theorist)

Prosocial Interpassivity vs. Negative Interpassivity











Christ, if Death had asked me to die instead of [[Bernard Stiegler]], I totally would have done it. Dude was at his peak.






Francois Laruellephant in the room decrees this - we shall split the internet into 2 halves:

1. Philosophy-positive: anyone who is capable of positively engaging with philosophy and/or non-philosophy.

2. Everyone else

3. Peter is moving to France by the end of the year for a PhD









We should have a metric that simply boasts less stupidity per capita

Art: get viz
- Map out proposal pipeline, dual
- Map out Cima code - use Kanban for keeping track of mods + routes

  80% of American art is 2 things:
  
  1. Activism
  2. Craft
  
  Hence, for thought, leave!
  
  
  
  
  
  "PTSD from being around so many individuals with PTSD"
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  To save lives: hack
  To educate: animate
  To live: move to a country with subsidized [[Autodidactic]] cultural infrastructure 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  ProSocialTV.Art is a TV station and art gallery based on a single speculative premise:
  
  What if the silent majority of the planet was actually as philostatistically skilled as Nikola Tesla, Alan Turing, Jesus, Buddha and God themselves, and were running ProSocialTV.art, a TV station and art gallery based on a single speculative premise: 
  
  What if the silent majority of the planet...

# Let's be "realistic":

1. The planet is fine; the humans are f-cked for like 40 years minimum.
2. Most countries don't have the coordination infrastructure or culture to address any crises effectively.
3. The planet as a whole is going to balance by ad hoc measures; most likely there will not be a massive enlightenment.
4. 80% of the planet's adults are anti-intellectuals; Gen Alpha will make older generations look like domesticated chickens on heroin.
5. Making fiction and hacking stuff with Gen Alpha is probably the only enjoyable things left on the planet; everyone else should just shroom because of lack of skills, (literally Hito Steyerl said this, there's a massive lack of skills everywhere).









Answer:
1. Gen Y is TV culture. It can watch, comment and perform, that's all.
2. Gen Alpha will be way more skilled and imaginative than every other generation.
3. The only sane thing to do is to write fiction for Gen Alpha and hack stuff with them.

Sweet christ are there any other cyberwarfare-savvy artists out there? I will give you $100 if you connect me with one.









Gen Y is a TV Generation, it has 3 skills:
- Watch / Perform (80%)
- Comment / Project Manage (15%)
- Post-produce / Architect (5%)

  Well f--k it, might as well start building a literate planetary art scene. Requirements:
  
  1. Knows philosophy and can write it, along with fiction and comedy
  2. Can perform and preferably, also box

  1. For artists: the easiest way to get press would simply be to hack, expose and devastate the existing institutions and markets.
  2. Exhibitions are horrible for education, animation is much better.
  
  Art in its current paradigm is not going to do anything; its basically alt-yuppie-life with 100x less pay.
  
  Unfortunately, 1 and 2 would require skills, which would require learning.

  There's kids that are 7 years old that know how to code.
  
  They are more skilled than 80% of older generations.

  Art for 6 months from now:
  
  1. Hack, expose and greymail existing institutions and markets into redistributing resources.
  2. Make philosophical animations.
  3. Exit everything else.

  That's about it- what else is there to do? 
  
  $1,000 prize for any artist who can actually make philostatistically verifiable 
  
  If we simply had a standardized [[Autodidactic]] test, things would be much easier.

  Artwork: "Prosocial is the New Cocaine: Snort the Books You Can't Understand, Instead of Snorting Coke Because You Can't Understand; then Share the Link to the Book for People Who Can Understand."
  
  Turn a whitepaper on Prosocial literacy into a heap of white dust which looks like cocaine; encourage viewer to snort the book and propagate a link to info, instead of snorting coke and sharing zero info.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  $100,000 USD art award for any artist or non-artists who's actually a [[polymath]] that could actually produce inventions to resolve today's crises, not simply just make some more boring ass sh-t.
  
  
  
  Artwork: I will give you free cocaine if you read enough Laruelle to not want it anymore.

  Stream/podcast:
- And people are encouraged to lurk/speculate - not talk.
  
  
  
  ---
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Brass tacks:
  
  1. Gen Y centric critical stream/TV/podcast; siphon money from the stupidity of physical exhibition culture.
  2. Bet against Gen X and elder, due to fragility. Expect a planetary self-balancing ETA for 50 years, as it stands. Offer Gen X/Z free cocaine for reading enough art and philosophy to become antifragile enough not to be driven by affect to the point that they won't take the free cocaine.
  3. Bet on Gen Alpha to have the skills to save the planet, make culture and infrastructure with them.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Ongoing performance artwork (for Gen Z and Gen X) by Chongha Peter Lee: I have the most intense PTSD from having the least PTSD on the planet.
  
  
  Least Stupid nfts
- Esta puppet - offer free cocaine for philostatically verifiable curation by someone smart enough to ask for shrooms rather than cocaine.
  
  
  
  
  -- ask Dan if the schema has been normalized
  
  
  
  Bet on bestideas / [[Regener888 (Main)]] (Skillenial Double [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Dragon Kings]] like Trogdor) = ppl who can talk
  
  Dashboard of crises and timeline / [[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/2 - EmergentCentersGraph/Playtheon]] Peace Games = Capt. Amasja
  
  Speculative Hackathon & Surreal News (esta + AI) + rock
  
  Online Happening (wedding + exorcism/divorce) = lectures
  
  Safe Space (chill out) = make art therapy, for you

# The U.S. is:
1. A service/drug economy with service worker specialists who can do 1 thing well, as long as they are supplied with adequate drugs and entertainment. 20% of their youth turns out antifragile.
2. So literally like 80% of the U.S. is either service work or drug dealing.
3. Forget art and philosophy, everyone else is too dumb and/or drugged out.
4. The only thing they can make is absurdity, comedy, murder and therapy.
5. The only way they can contribute to solving the planet's crises is to donate cash.
# get success for what?!

A word can't be a sign.
# Cultural notes:

1. France tends to be formalist as a resistance to the stupidity of elites and masses.
2.
