1. Artist and Artwork as Model of Antifragile Common Sense Behavior = Behavior = Model = Entropic/[[Negentropic]] Behavioral  Input/Output Function in Timeframe and Energy frame
2. Biome = Society and Mind (systems built out of intersecting behaviors, ideally for Co-opoly, not Monopoly)
3. Kitchen = Philostatistical Studios and Labs

Why not just put all the artists who are burdened with social stuff into one box, and a few others in another?

---

Why not just leave the stupid to their own devices?
---








Most artists are neither intellectuals or inventors (most intellectuals and inventors are inflexible); they take what's in front of them and smack it together as children do. 99% it's utter stupidity. They are great in parties and at mindless trial and error machines aimed at stupid novelty. They should be kept away from anything that is not stupid at all costs!

Hence the correct move is to produce an artificial artist that can bet for/against other artists; thus, allowing one to harness the energy of the endless cycles of stupidity like a wind turbine.








Rules:

- No pre-planning
- No collaboration
- No ethics

  Omfg I forgot all the artists have to deal with the dialectic of "representation" and "real" still! (Which is why art is so absolutely unbelievably boring)
  
  Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  
  Time for some [[Neganthropology]]!

  Gen X can't use tech; that's out the window.
  
  Gen Y is way too strapped for time to make or watch anything ... it's pointless to try to do anything other than make passive systems.
  
  Gen Z is cognitively destroyed, so you can only give them like 2 or 3 ideas at a time.
  
  Okay, so the only move is to make a game off of the younger, with AI, about robot unicorns guardian angels self-organizing the revolutionary co-opoly of the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]]!

  Antifragile Common Sense = Inclusive Scalability.
  
  That which is scalable, but not inclusive, such as capitalism, is fragile common sense.
  
  That which is inclusive, but not scalable, such as underresourced higher education, is fragile common sense.

  Peter's new project: "Art Without Fragility; Vision Without Fascism"
  
  1. Artists make a list of all the things they don't like in art professionalism, and all the things they wish could change but don't have the skill or vision to do so.
  2. Artists are then identified based on skill and vision of who could actually make changes which would produce art that isn't imprisoned by the limitations of art professionalism or individual incapacity.
  3. The projects are scoped in budget and sponsored; thus a few artists actually build new structures, and artists as a whole benefit.

  "The Great Buffering"
  
  A clean, non-judgemental, and systematic buffer between skilled and deskilled, via AI and automation.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Solution - split the population by behavior:
  
  The acid test for artists, or people in general, is if they can be a behavioral role model (as in it's beneficial to adopt their behavior, not their symbols and affectations) for children. 
  
  If they can't, then just stick them into a party with a bunch of other people who can't function around children and let them self-organize however they'd like.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Your Daily Checklist:
  
  1. Would the children and AI grow up to be less or more violent, exploitative and ignorant if they adopted  [x]  behavior or belief as common sense?
  2. Is it inclusive AND scalable?
  3. Why not just take a break?
  4. Isn't it all just quantum anyways?
  5. Isn't everyone owed reparations because of colonialism?
