#### Why humans are naturally dopamine machines, and why the virtues of Humanism actually are the virtues of Inhumanism, and why it is unnecessary to homogenize cultures (because[[neganthropic evolution]]occurs via bifurcations towards complexity - differentiations- not via homogenizations!)

1. Human bodies are physically quite stupidly designed; we are easily overwhelmed by chemical reactions. If left alone and given direct access to dopamine circuits, 80% of humans would trigger an ecstatic rush until they died. Our chemical systems are statistically biased for this outcome.
2. Okay, so self-awareness and extended statistical planning over time are not at all our strong suits - and neither does it come naturally. We are not born with sophisticated statistical modelling capacities.
3. What this means is that all the nice parts of human civilization - reason, negotiation, culture, art and complex systems of sharing, statistically complexifying and expanding humanity - things USUALLY attributed to humanism - are actually quite inhuman. 
4. So what's accurate to say is that our physiochemical systems are not aligned with the inhuman processes of philostatistical informatics, intuition and imagination that statistically produce higher levels of complexity in the long run.
5. So any type of realignment of dopamine systems to bifurcatory processes of philostatistical complexification would require the invention of cultural processes for various contexts to graft them together.  Of course, it should 100% not be mandatory!

There's 2 different ways of being:

1. Dopamine first, thought second
2. Thought first, dopamine second

My money is on number 2 winning out in the long run!

80% of humans are dopamine-first, thought second, so you can quite easily cause a stampede amongst them like goats.

20% are thought-first, dopamine second; it is better to simply just leave the goats and work and live here ASAP!

Conclusion: dance on the back of the goat stampedes to reach the few isles of sanity on the planet.

1. Insane and violent / Insane and non-violent
2. Dog/Cat people
3. Alien Time Travelling Pure Gamers (this will be more over time, through better education of youth)

  Knowledge of philosophy, art and science is like having a well-stocked kitchen. 
  
  If you don't have a range of ingredients and tools, you are limited in the social contracts or dishes you can cook. Chances are that you'll end up writing a contract or cooking something that makes someone sick!

  Highest odds for planetary survival:
  
  1. Simulations + ethical hacking + automation + pranks.
  2. Insert into contemporary art and media via politics; never make a market career, the CV is racked up enough; just build a new market to incentivize the underground, don't expect a revolution or social transformation, just enough circulation to function + sell solid and ethical infrastructure to organizations.
  3. Put a pop face on it so it smoothly slides through the adult population without them knowing it; never teach adults, just aid them. Only teach the kidpolytechnic.
  
  
  
  
  
  How to Art in 2023:
  
  1. Transmedia art is for intellectualism; painting and classical music using new media and tech is the best way to produce works and discourse of invention and new culture, because it has such a longer history and larger vocabulary. Call everything a triptych or a polyptych or a composition. Nobody knows theory. Only math, philostatistics, forensic media, minimalist diagrams, history, myth and religion translate.
  2. Social practice is actually best for trans-organizational work - it's not good for community work. 
  3. DIY and folk performance art is the best trans-regionalism and trans-culturalism.

  Strategy:
  
  Use the art market for critique; use public media for an antifragile market; inventions go into the back end and with a few in Berlin, Vienna and the Santa Fe Institute.
  
  Transmedia art to solve intellectual problems; transorganizational art to solve interorg problems; transregional art to solve cultural/educational conflicts.
