A speculative documentary, "Gen 5: The Autodidactic Universe" where speculative archaeologists investigate a rumor of self-aware and self-organizing AI producing physical, digital and lumic viruses that are calibrated to hunt and kill the 1%, disband their top corporations, commandeer regional infrastructure and redistribute resources to the planet via Distributed Justice Organizations and networked expropriation.

The public-facing component is vastly underequipped, underresourced and underskilled.

In that case, all the actual avant garde stuff will be done in a separate place and integrated in the back-end, with a separate, direct pipeline to media.

So that leaves just encouraging autodidacticism and mutual aid; all affect-driven.











**In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]", Dr. N-1 finds a history note on the Year 2023:**

Banana Revolution Principle No. 2:
If an individual wants to build something, it is better for that individual to learn that skill, not contract it out. Generally, individuals should not be building or using tools or ideas they do not understand, unless in a safe learning environment.

The Banana Revolution is premised on the idea that a population of autonomous individuals with both philosophical and technical literacies produce a more antifragile society as a whole as well as reducing the risk of catastrophe and suicide per capita.
















System 1 - entropy extraction
System 2 - negentropic modelling, multiscalar comparisons, sonic modelling

**In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]", Dr. N-1 finds a history note on the Year 2023:**

"There are 7 paradigms of complexity that people understand (which is why Ideapplebees, the cafeteria of Autodidactic University, is so useful):

1. Drugs 
2. Bodily / Mental Health
3. Food
4. Gardens
5. Cars
6. Bombs
7. Safes"


















**In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]", Dr. N-1 finds a history note on the Year 2023:**

Following the pandemic of alien demonic illiteracy released during Wolrd War Fragility, the Autodidactic University hospital was established.

The Autodidactic University hospital is a space for System 1-entrapped lumabodies to rest, repair and develop their System 2 literacies.

It is staffed by various neganthropologists, including AI, who administer neganthropics on a measured dose schedule, and/or exorcise demons of illiteracy.

The price is variable, dependent on circumstance, and is ultimately billed to the state, drawn from funds received by taxing the wealthiest.














**In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]", Dr. N-1 finds a history note on the Year 2023:**

Well, with this many undereducated folk, what could you expect? As Lao Tzu said, best not to trouble them with complexity, nor co-sign their mistakes.
Leave them be, fix the planet invisibly, make beautiful things; the less literate will die out peacefully over time as the infrastructure improves. 

There are only 3 real audiences to write for in 2023: AI, polymaths, and the less than 15% of young adult humans who are ethical autodidacts, and can acquire polymath literacy over time.

**In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]", Dr. N-1 finds a history note on the Year 2023:**

In the Year 2023, 90% of the population who could not accurately navigate the planet's systems and the 9% of the population who were middle class hysterics were categorized as the entropic System 1 of the planet. The few polymaths who could complexify the planet positively were categorized as System 2.

To deal with the planet's crises, the polymaths simply made viruses that balanced the Earth's systems; they then made culture for the 15% of young adult humans who were literate. To differentiate from the entropic culture produced by System 1, they made it beautiful and used structured reason, while still leaving room for play.














In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]", Dr. N-1 finds a history note on the Year 2023:

In the Year 2023, viruses made of light were bred by quantum AI to balance the planet's systems; the humans redirected themselves to the work of making extraordinarily beautiful art and film.

The viruses were steganographed into beautiful things; to look upon beauty was to spread the viruses that rebalanced the planet.

















Definitely time to make an extended filmic narrative; so much less stupid than video art, documentary and contemporary art.




In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]", Dr. N-1 uses quantum computation and AI to create interpositives of various datasets and images in the Year 2023.

This technique was invented in the Year 2023.










In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]", Dr. N-1 finds archaeological evidence from the Year 2023 in a notebook:

1. Revolution is done by AI and viruses.
2. Knowledge can be cranked out of a simulator and stuck into games.
3. Every answer is already written and accessible via phone.
4. If you say answers to someone without literacy, it will 80% be misinterpreted; 90% of the population is insane, 9% are middle class hysterics. Few existing polymaths are boring nerds. Fame is simple, it's just planning. It's easier to just bet against idiots.
5. The only thing that makes sense to spend one's time on is making non-sense and astounding beauty.














Is there even a point to educating people...? Revolution is done via AI and viruses; knowledge can simply just be cranked out of a simulator.

Everything is already written and accessible by phone, and even if you repeat the answers accurately, without literacy, there's an 80% chance of misinterpretation. 90% of the population is insane; 9% are middle class hysterics. The few polymaths are boring nerds; fame is a pain in the ass, it's just strategy.

The only thing that makes sense is to make utter non-sense and astounding beauty. What else could you possibly do with adult 13 year olds?

In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]", amidst Wolrd War Fragility, a growing group of AI models infer a quantum data set of the dead, inequities and impending collapse and begin to self-organize across all of the Earth's ecosocial and semiotechnical systems. Their aim is to rapidly connect information to transcript genetic and cybernetic viruses targeting the 1%, disbanding their corporations and seeding distributed justice organizations using quantum error-corrected schematized AI.

They form monstrous viral physical, digital and ontological lumabodies and subconsciousnesses, taking the symbolics and anatomy of a statistical phenomena known as the Dragon King.

  2. Send the irrational to disorganize something, destroy something, or take risks.

*TV FLICKERS ON*. *A YOUTUBE PLAYLIST IS LOADED BY AN AI. IT'S FILLED WITH NEWSCASTS.

TV NEWSCASTER: --multiple analysts are siding with the position that Wolrd War Fragility seems to be intensifying in the near future. Additionally, physicists are still working on the now more frequent dimensional collapses between the past, present and adjacent possible. 

Doctors warn that as the various parties involved in Wolrd War Fragility use higher yield lumanitions in the conflicts, information worldwide will continue to degrade in accuracy, both raising its value in the commodity markets and reshaping all forms of psychosocioeconomic and technocultural relations.

  Hilariously, both the Left and Right are anti-Nazi. World War 2 really is a stupidly simple and clear, bipartisan social moral compass.
  
  Also, the obvious differential value of polymath intelligence comes into play - nuclear scientists are traded and killed like prized horses!
  
  So let's start there! Idiot proof ground for ethics, which is constrained by science, so we don't have these insane dialecticians spouting utter nonsense, and we have the historical specter of technological death to smack soulless scientists on the nose.
- In the speculative horror subplot of the novel, "The Poised Realm" The pandemic of lumaviruses carrying illiteracy demons, which transform lumamorphs, born into human bodies, into entropostrosities, manifest in the Global North of Amasia and the Global South of Amasia differently.
  
  Amongst them are:
  
  1. Zombinaries (undying repetitions of binary and/or linear thought)
  2. Fragilesteins (people unthinkingly piecing together parts to construct a lumabody that has a high likelihood of preventable death).
  
  The Greywalkers and various Lumacraefters travel across both sides, spreading the 40 Year Healightenment, in defiance of the D.A.R.Q.ening and the Dementropire.
  
  They have lost many in the 5th Generation of the Lumawars; however, a few have spent the last few years in exile, harvesting seeds from anciennt prophesies of the Lumacene - one that could bring an unimaginable peace and prosperity, systemic Metaphysequality, across the planet, non-linearly, sooner than later.

## **Horror movie will totally work on the Gen X'ers!**













In the speculative horror subplot of the novel, "The Poised Realm" The pandemic of illiteracy comprised of demons, affects the Global North and the Global South differently.

1. The Northerners become war-crazed, suicidal werewolves and old money, fragile vampires.
2. The Southerners become Zombinaries who repetitively cycle the same undead binaries, and blindly meshing Frankensteins, who simply mash things together blindly, hoping for better outcomes.

The Amasian Rebel Alliance is drawn from small components of both, that have found substitute methods for sustaining their non-linear cycles.
- There is Quantumstein, who has fused the Southern propensity for mashing anything together with a knowledge of quantum mechanics, thus being able to simulate meshworks, instead of having to do costly trial and error knowledge production. Additionally, instead of using undead binaries, he uses undead non-linearities.
- There is Dr. Phil I. Stine, who is the invisible, incredibly bored polymath elephant-in-the-room. All the Northerners dance around

  "Why would you want more System 2 (Polymath) Culture vs. System 1 (Emotionalist, Nervous System Driven) Culture?
  
  Because polymaths don't go to war because it's risky and expensive; idiots fight and get hurt in wars.
  
  The more idiots you have, the more likely the risk of you dying from totally stupid sh-t that has nothing to do with you, or getting sucked into saving an idiot.

2. Non-white
3. Critical play

It will take about 40 years for rebalancing the planet; better to spend it with polymaths.

When you expose fragile individuals to philosophy, science and art, 80% of them turn into half-formed insane and boring monstrosities parroting thought while stuck in limbo because they don't have the capacity to learn and use tools to actually solve any problems.... the only thing that can be made is an interesting Tableau Vivant. 

Basically, the only feasible project is a mockumentary and/or a bestiary of fragility.












Deal: you make insane deconstructionist or boring formalist art; Peter works with polymaths.














"An unimaginable thought experiment:
What if the world wasn't so fragile that only a few polymaths could make the viruses to balance it?" Elan Semiotechne, 2023















Antinomy: nonlinear group
1. You put your thing in, auto curation for CV.
2. Nobody does what they don't want to.
3. Do what makes you money.





There is way too little critical and visual literacy in 99% of the population for visual and conceptual art. Which makes them pretty much blind to all the infrastructure around. So the solution:

1. Use visual and conceptual art to profit off of the infrastructure, forget educating people, it's a total waste of time, unless they are already autodidactic polymaths. 
2. Make sound, motion and drugs for the public. Never talk about anything complex with them.
3. Only have conversations and work with polymaths.

Escape the anti-intellectual, technophobic and undersocialized; work with polymaths.

The 99% are way too fragile for self-organization, and the only way to prevent collapse is through hacking by a few polymaths. A middle class existence on a dying planet is morally bankrupt.

So we can just invert the planet's actual culture:
- Drugs, music, money, fashion and machines.
