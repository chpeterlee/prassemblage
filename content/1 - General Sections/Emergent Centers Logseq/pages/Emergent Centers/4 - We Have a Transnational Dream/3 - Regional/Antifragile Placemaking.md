The entire craft of intelligence is making weird, arbitrary puzzles for the unintelligent so they don't go f--king nuts and kill intelligent people.

Best just to automate this.















# "The Least Stupid Self", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023















## You know why you're a superpositional saint? 

1. All things exist in quantum superposition - multiple states simultaneously.
2. There's the you who you think you are; and there's the you who has all the best aspects of you right now, but is also a polymath genius with a great sense of humor and fashion, that can actually save the planet.
3. Hard to imagine, right? You're just a normal person â€” which is normal to think, without having a quantum simulator to photograph your TRUE YOU. 
4. Let's see what the simulators reveal in your quantum portrait!
5. Let's also see how your future you is subconsciously starting a quantum revolution to save the planet in the present, through your body, without you even realizing it! 
6. The true you will even be able to solve all your relationship problem















Triage:

1. Stick all the deskilled together in a simulator with zero agenda. The Postworkverse, and Banana Revolution as Superpositional Saints. Expect nothing. (99% of the population).
-  Give 1 concept in a maximum of 3 words. Never ask for thought.
-  Stoic body language and fashion.
-  Deconstructionist music and gesture.

2. Stick all the skilled, antifragile individuals into a place - expect emergent self-organization. Compete for prizes to save the planet.




Clearly, a total collapse of the functional components of modern society has occurred. 

All we have is a bunch of insane and incurably fragile individuals and a bunch of hyperskilled individuals, such as yours trh
