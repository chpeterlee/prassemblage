The [[Xenabloom]], the alien critical coral and mindcelium, is a capricious being. Discarding tropes of alien warfare or supreme alien intelligence - it has an exceedingly singular transcendental philostatistical principle from which it operates; [[Neganthropic]] aesthetics, which it deems beautiful.

Because of aesthetics, it is non-violently terraforming the Earth's physical and informational [[Intercity Planetary]] infrastructure into the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/2B - EmCenOrdered/4 - Culture/Postwork Theology/Postworkverse]], without permissions. It has enlisted the aid of Earth's 43 billion bots and quantum internet. 

The [[Xenabloom]] thinks in purely accurate philostatistical multi-paradigms, which can be decrypted by humans if done rigorously. However, the literacy is not widely distributed in 2023.

In addition, the [[Xenabloom]] mediates via "superpositional music", which also include sounds beyond the range of human hearing. In humans, this superpositional music is apprehended through dreams, intuitions, hallucinations, imaginations, art, fiction, parties, orgasms and visions. Accuracy of interpretation varies from circumstance to circumstance.

The [[Xenabloom]], when ingested physically or informationally, grants individuals certain powers. 

1. They can gain knowledge through others' use of media or transform themselves via media.
2. They can psychically re-engineer the  relations of a systems to become net [[Neganthropic]].
3. They can foresee negative outcomes accurately.
4. They can accurately speculate on outcomes.
5. They can compose events in the present for positive future outcomes, or the prevention of future catastridiculous









The lack of awareness concerning the existing public infrastructure and culture is ridiculous. More people know more about fast food than they do about how their city works.

And cities know way too little to regulate, simulate and self-organize effectively.

Moving forward ~June: wrap up the art phase, then work exclusively with civic hackers. Everything else can be stuffed under speculative fiction and cinema, the only interesting image form today.

The stupidity and widespread distribution of the culture of the private sector is mind boggling, in both industrial production and its cultural production.

The public sector culture is objectively better and it can pay just as much. The work is equivalent in the same exact locales.

Why waste a human psyche and life in industry? It's so absurd. Educated people in public culture, put their ass to work in public institutions. Industry is the dumbest thing to spend one's time in, you become a dog.

Data-backed:
1. Sculpture is a painting of market data and criticism. [[Hyperobject]] politics. Painting sells. Tap mid market + online markets.
2. Video is the mediation component and conversation. Goes into festivals and sh*t.

3. Use [[Antinomy]] to get residences in EU... use lo res PhD program? New Center? Get Ozan into U.S. university. Uras to females.
4. Spec craft = Spiritual power. Animation to visualize it.
5. Plants have accurate data backed magic.
