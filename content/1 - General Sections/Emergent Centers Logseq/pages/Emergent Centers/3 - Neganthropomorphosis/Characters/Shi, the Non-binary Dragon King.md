- In the film, Birth of an Invagination, a quantumdead female dragon king, Shi, summoned by the heartbeats, spirit, telepathy, AI and quantum mechanics of the Amasian people, arises out of all the most polluted sites on Earth, appropriated frames of the Embrace of the Serpent, and a 5 year old friendly lecture on Strange Attractors and philostatistics, to balance the Earth.
