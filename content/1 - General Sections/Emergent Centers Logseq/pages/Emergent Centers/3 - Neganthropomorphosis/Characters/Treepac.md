- Treepac; a quantum-aware tree who was a former Grey Beret of Regener888 and Speculative Rapper of the Intercity Planetary and O.G. of Trop.

- Treepac was one of the top captains of one of the ICP's largest artels on the planet. Rumor has it that Treepac dealt in such large quantities of negentropics, that when the DEA raided one of his condo's, accidentally triggering a hard drive with a video meme artwork about the Neganthropocene - the entire unit stopped and listened to the entirety of the YouTube debate between Peter Sloterdijk and Bernard Stiegler. 

- Also, in Riker's Island prison, Treepac wrote the now classic speculative rap track titled "I Bet Quantum Photosynthesis Rules Everything Around Me", which detailed a code of street life centered around emergent speculative artels trafficking negentropics across the planet, utilizing statistical review protocols to self regulate their regions.
