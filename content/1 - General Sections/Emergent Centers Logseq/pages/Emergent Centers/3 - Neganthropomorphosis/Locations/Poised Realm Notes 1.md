### "In [[Postworkcraft]], the planet has 3 enemies:

 1. **The 1%'s Planetary Plantation transcontinental wrestling matches, played via private military contractors and air assaults.**
2. People dying needlessly of preventable causes.
3. Boring culture by both dumb, nice people and psychotic, vicious people." 

Chongha Peter Lee, 2023


**Excerpt from "The Superpositional Fugitive"**

Reportedly, Chongha Peter Lee, the Superpositional Fugitive, committed accuratecide of multiple impossibilities through ingeniously constructed statistical architectural traps.





**Excerpt from "The Superpositional Fugitive":**

Extracts from Chongha Peter Lee's journals suggest that his ontological metabolism was drastically transformed after he was injected with the premises of radical immanence, the [[Autodidactic Universe]] and inclusive scalability.

He ceased dealing with the entrapments of both representational politics and blind anarchy, and instead produced 5th Generation Art - statistical architectures.








**Excerpt from "[[Fragilicide.live]]":**

It is necessary to note that in the year 2023, Thought is a dead corpse in the [[Intercity Planetary]] street; yet Anti-Intellectualism, Technophobia and Awkward Desocialization are very much still at large, indiscriminately poisoning water supplies everywhere.

Stalwart citizens of the [[Intercity Planetary]] have begun testing their water, not to be entropoisoned by these nefarious conceptual criminals, who most likely are affiliates of the Dementropire.






In **[[Fragilicide.live]]**, [[polymath]] transmedia artist and Antifragile Agent, Chongha Peter Lee, hunts an Ethical Future version of himself - [[Elan Semiotechne]].

[[Elan Semiotechne]] has committed several Ethical Future crimes. He is wanted for multiple **articides** of impossibilities, inaccuracies and fragilities, which he has framed the present Chongha Peter Lee for. He may or may not be responsible for the killing of Thought.

In an attempt to clear his name, Chongha Peter Lee bargains with the [[Ethical Futures Institute]] Speculative Forensics Department to give him 6 months to catch [[Elan Semiotechne]] and bring him to justice.

**Yes. You're right. These thoughts are not your usual Fragile you.

**It's the real You, the one that has been waiting silently, in this darkness.

**It's The You that you hear thinking in a thousand voices while reading this text silently.

The[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]Renaissance Tale and complexity science fantasy novel **The [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Narrative/Poised Realm]]** follows the writings of a future eccentric[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]Renaissance [[polymath]] named [[Dr. N-1]] , working at **[[Neganthropomorphosis/pages/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Organizations/Autodidactic University]]** and the **[[[[[[Emergent Centers]]]]s]]**.

1. [[Dr. N-1]] is leading an[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]Response Team (A.R.T.) of speculative archaeologists, lumacologists and [[Neganthropologist]]s working 600 million years in the future. They are in the midst of solar change - a situation when the sun is heating up and thus sending all photosynthesis-based life towards extinction creating political instability across the world; it mirrors our current planet-scale ecosocial crises, but is exponentially harder to solve.
2. While [[Dr. N-1]] and his team are archiving and excavating the history of our year, the year 2023, we can also be aware of how they are cataloging and archiving and narrating it, through quantum simulators, which operate in the **[[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Narrative/Poised Realm]]**, through physical systems that can transform reversibly between classical and quantum mechanics.
3. [[Dr. N-1]]s speculative archaeological, lumacological and neganthropological tools include perspectival fiction, Steganographic Documentaryand statistically verifiable art as a method to bridge the [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Narrative/Poised Realm]]; because of this, as we interact in the present and transform their future archive, [[Dr. N-1]] and their team can indirectly shape our present, via a quantum tunnel interface formed by imagination, called the MetaPhysEqualizer. In this invaginating space of our imagination, we can only see partial projections of Dr N. and his team's actions, which frequently intermix with our own past, present or adjacent possible.

## Why being an amateur scientist is smart, being a low quality Humanities amateur is agonizingly stupid:

Sciences produce novelty accidentally constantly, because you're dealing with machinic, probabilistic systems. Then they get in self-induced gridlocks because they specialize. You have a decent shot of inventing stuff by just going in, reading and playing. Material systems are incredibly dynamic!

Humanities are context and history based heuristics - thus it's faster to read the history and learn the existing knowledgebase than to invent humanity from scratch. Seriously, why reinvent the wheel? And suffer through low quality Humanities b.s.? *(of course is this going to stop the historyless modernites from blundering head-first into trying? No, of course not. Ultimately, just childish nonsense.)*
### "Simple Wager: sciences would be more inclusively scalable with less hierarchy; Humanities would be more inclusively scalable with proper incentivization and statistical verification.", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

## **Once upon a time in the complexity science fantasy reality game, *"THE [[1 - General Sections/Emergent Centers Logseq/pages/Emergent Centers/3 - Neganthropomorphosis/Narrative/Poised Realm]]: THE ETERNAL RETURN OF THE DRAGON KING"*** -

The Superpositional seed of Shi, the Dragon King, was distributed throughout the lands of Amasia in the Year 2023. 

But this was no lowly dirt scrum to be wedged in soil; rather this was a crystalline womb, bearing the dark and iridescent body of the Dragon King, growing and scrabbling in the brains of all the Earth's feminists, resonating at faster than light speed.

This resonance manifested as the Thundering Silence of A Billion Dead Dragon Mothers that they heard in their head as they read a text; a voice that was just as much the spirit of imagination itself, as it was the fragments of their experiences â€” born of Hell, blood and loss.

It was this Voice that scraped its scaly dragons claws louder and louder in the minds of feminists across the planet, in the year 2023, carving out and whispering a single line of poetry:

"The Birth of an Invagination: [[Until We Are Worth More Than Gold (Main)]]."

   In the novel, "[[Fragilicide Live - the 5th Turn]]" , [[Dr. N-1]] excavates a note from an intellectual in the Year 2023:
  "How to navigate 2023 society:
  1. Money, work, chemicals, gifts and theater roles for the population. (Only 15% of the children are [[Autodidactic]]; the rest should make[[0. Personal/Peter Obsidian/Neganthropomorphosis/pages/Amasian]]Renaissance Theater!)
   2. Political/knowledge stuff for the midsize orgs. (40 to 100 year solutions, don't get caught up in this mess, automate it).

He sends these notes back to the Year 2023 by reducing them to potential energy systems, which appear in our Year 2023 as the imagination and poetic output of the art group [[Antinomy]], abducted through its 8th member, an antennae made of neganthropo.site:

  "The Lightslingers were the few transmedia [[polymath]] artists on Earth in 2023, who evidenced a rare synthesis of 3 traits: intelligence, imagination and courage.
  
  They found each other outside of institutions, in grey markets , dive bars and obscure fictions across the planet. They earned their keep by maintaining the planet's infrastructure, but they lived in an utterly different reality than most due to their technical skills, ethics and playfulness.
  
  [[Neganthropologist]]s of the 22nd Century have categorized them as being of a different species, Homo Neganthropos."
