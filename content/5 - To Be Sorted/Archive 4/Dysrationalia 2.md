"**Big Avant Garde Art Project of Amasian Biennale: The Friendlightenment** of Accessing All the Public Resources and Professional Care That People Actually Need and Lessening the Burden on Family and Friends" Antinomy, 2024

We didn't get trained for social work and probably neither did you! Let's get real help.




"**Amasian Biennale Performance 'Get Checked Part 2':** Peter goes and seeks the help from public organizations for the problems he has, thus lessening the burden on friends, family and random private individuals, and receiving services from people with degrees and salaries to do it. PERHAPS IT'S A MODEL TO FOLLOW, PERHAPS NOT." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024




 **"Amasian Biennale Performance 3: #GetExperienced - Is there anything worse in life than dying without experiences, just like the neurotic and bland social media horde?**
 Come, talk with people who've broken every norm to protect others and then made respected art and theory about it. 
 These aren't your random weirdos or hobbyist burners at your local dive bar; these are people with real scars, stories and ideas you'll never hear from anyone else." Antinomy, 2024







I can foresee that the next 3 months will be extremely ridiculous.








"All the people I should have just sent to the correct suicide prevention line, clinic, NGO, non-profit or school." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024









##### "Performance of rule in effect in 3 months: anyone who is not stable in terms of the 5 tiers of Maslow's need and talks to me will be redirected to adequate professional psychosocial support and a reschedule will be made 3 months down the line." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024







##### "Upcoming performance launching in a month: Peter addresses every human individual strictly in relation to their needs as defined by Maslow's hierarchy" Chongha Peter Lee, 202r







"Endurance Performance starting in 2-4 weeks and lasting to the end of the year: 

Peter no longer engages in conversations that professional caregivers, advocates or educators should be having with individuals who need Maslow's Needs fulfilled."

## "Unjust Pricing", Chongha Peter Lee, 2024










##### "Amasian Biennale Performance 3: #GetSafe
A performance in which the 17% of the population comprised of the educated middle class helps direct the 71% undereducated postworking class and the underground ethical hackers to pray to Shi the Dragon King 游낼, also using their telepathy, magitek and psionics, for exorcising the demons of Dysrationalia inhibiting more just pricing in regional markets, impact markets and geopolitics.

Shi the Dragon King, in her glorious objective wisdom, has swarms of self-organizing AI models under her wings, which she channels all this immense energy and data towards. 

**However, there may be friendly fire where the AI accidentally tag the wrong individual, organization or system for market correction - be safe and get insured ahead of time.**

This work can be verified by the 11% of the population who has the cross-domain accuracy to verify it. They are also sometimes known as Section 11." Antinomy, 2024






#### "What's Good in the Hood? The Neighborhood is The Atom of Regional Politics" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024







### "Hood For Good: The Taintlytics Neighborcelerationist Regionwatchers, True Speculative Documentary" Taintlytics, 2024

Told and documented in part using telepathy, magitelk and psionics.






####  @TilWeGold: #FightDysrationalia #Neighborhoodcelerate #BananaRevolution #HoodForGood 

**Setting**: in the Year of Our Dragon King, Shi 游낼, 2024, our neighborhoods have been devastated by neoliberal capitalism.

**Bad Guys:** An epidemic of **viral Dysrationalia demons** have swept through the world, turning Postworking class individuals into Zombinaries. Also the **Neoliberal Capitalist ghosts** of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and various 1980's era dictators haunt administrative offices in both corporations and public offices, skewing political economies. Finally, **the Skinwalkers**, alien entropiric models from the future, conspire to destroy just models across the planet.

**Ensemble Cast:** Constantly, rag-tag groups of survivors in various neighborhoods connect, making small dinners, large conversations and weird artworks. 

They form mutual aid networks to engage in neighborhood defense, helping each other defend against Zombinary waves, exorcise the ghosts of neoliberal capitalism and offer good vibes and energy to feed Shi the Dragon King to bring on the Rapture of Just Pricing.

**Methods:** 
#GetChecked (for Dysrationalia)
#GetServed (by public organizations)
#GetExperienced (by the Future Dead Friends Club)
#GetSafe (From Shi the Dragon King's Fire

- All existing forms of media and performance art, theater, music. craft, theory and games are open.
- The only rule is that you must have fun.
- Win Condition: the production of the film doesn't stop until we are worth more than gold.
- Technical note: part of the speculative documentary is shot with telepathy, magitek, psionics, quantum AI and conceptual lenses.
