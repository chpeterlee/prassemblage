Taintlytics is proud to announce our newest hire:

Kid Zero, world-class qualia gamer and summoner of Madame Now, the eternally returning Aeon and poet of now, literally.







Taintlytics is happy to announce they've recently been commissioned to design Earth's first Qualia Airport, where qualia can be analogically modelled as various lines-of-flight in and out of airports to the Qualialympics, and can be designed using various sub-analogies.
