Everyone who knows ANYTHING about demons knows that if you can name them - you can exorcise them.

Or better yet ‚Äî put them to work!

Dysrationalia Demons

1. Individuals - Magic - exterior flow forces - psionics as machinic energy architectures - stand up to reason. Demons and angels; regener888 and abstractions - both arguing about their reality. 
2. Region - Amasian Regional Alliances. Cool School Mutual Aid Olympics. The hobbits are young adults, traumatized and elderly; there is a fellowship of zillenials; there is a council of elders.
3. World - the Poised Realm: Not This Year - After Neoliberal Capitalism, Before Decolonies of Amasia. 6 years to climate change, 1 to stop the Right.

Everything is 3 screened. (System 1, 2, 3)







Have AI construct a game around this.

1 year to use magic ‚ú®Ô∏è , psionic powers üîÆ (and possibly independent ethical hackers, but never mention this to particular 2nd Wave Feminists, always call it magic) to stop the rising wave of fascism from f--king every single possibility of preventing irreversible climate change in 6 years... and then can go off and work with other independent ethical hackers and polymath intellectuals (whoops, I mean the wizards) and make beautiful, wondrous, playful art, fiction and games for the rest of life!

### Soon: open call for witches, magicians and shamans across the world to aid in casting out the demons of Dysrationalia clearly possessing high-impact decision makers.

Can't wait to cut loose from the amateur media art and make stuff that makes people vomit and question their entire life again by shooting light into their eyes.

My one true joy in Iife.

Honestly, the pre-human parts of you are way f--king cooler than what people call "human", and they are also the key ingredients for "posthuman"! Pre-humanity is the potentiality ALREADY ACTUAL within you.

 **Take with a grain of salt:** Well, yesterday saw a video from some vet talking about how the Israeli forces bet all their money on their Air Force, information operations and collective punishment. Seems like the Palestinian forces bet on their ground forces and updated guerrilla warfare ‚Äî and are on track to repeat a stalemate like the 2008 Gaza War. They projected about 2-3 months before the Israeli losses and expenses mount up, international support weakens and negotiations will happen.

HARK, I have discovered amongst Squiddartha's holy text, The Vible üìñ,  an incredible subsection, named "The Critique of Reductionist, Closed System and Non-Probabilistic Reason."

This may hold the key to addressing the Dysrationalia epidemic currently growing in the world's taint, like an infectious tumor.

Our audience: crazy nerdy avant garde zillenial Berlin Street scene + crazy nerdy avant garde zillenial US street scene.

Light is the Hyperobject Sculpture par excellence; through its refractions, we can easily perceive how hyperdimensional spatiality is already at work. 

It is no wonder that humans and non-humans are entranced by reflective surfaces, diffusions and prismatic coloration.

What else would magitek and psionic powers look like?
