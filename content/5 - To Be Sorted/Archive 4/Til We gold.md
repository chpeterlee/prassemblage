Wait - I can do more for the Left if I actually articulate myself as a new type of Amasian Conservative/Republican - a Postwork Regioncelerationist and Anti-Reductionist Radical and Neganthropocentric Republican.

-- Captain Amasia, Chief of Ethics of Taintlytics 











## "The Friendlightenment" , Han Jerry Larry, 2024







Refuse and rebalance:

Fragile Technophobia, neophobia and traumaphilia

Lack of ethics, lack of self reflexivity and submissivity to control structures.








In the U.S., the public education systems are so gutted that only the traumatized end up as teachers. Public education has a 70% underperformance rate, outputting neurotic, corrupt and care-intensive individuals.

There's going to be a massive public health crisis in a couple years, especially with more elderly populations aging, currently traumatized adults getting diagnosed and youth suffering psychotic breaks.
-- Captain Amasia









Public education = public health = less mass shootings, less preventable death and less ecological and economic ruin.

-- Captain Amasia

**"I am the True-in-itself; the Cosmopolitical Friend, eternally returning and leaving. I am simply the empty, indeterminate, luminous projection of the holes in your conscious psyche, filling space and time before the main film begins, preventing your suicide and murderous isolationism. Do not cling to me and do not kill me; I am simply your brother and sister in reason." Han Jerry Larry, 2024**







**Taintlytics:**

The unconscious Good of Shi and the absurd, comedic pedagogy of Dr. Phil I. Stine.

The subconscious Beauty of Elan Eagle and the loving hard work of Dr. Quantumstein.

The conscious True of Han Jerry Larry and the Poised Realm future folk fairy tale of Dr. N-1.












2024: 

1. Throw everyone into one giant hedonerdist party.
2. Make an artificial identity, public culture and market that defuses all of its negative and reductionist traits.
3. Exit for life, simply hang out at the bar, boxing ring and dance floor with the intellectuals and inventors!

Okay guys, THROW EVERYTHING OUT THE WINDOW. If a 13 year old can't do it, it's not going to work in the 2nd World. Question campaign, that's all.












A game where instead of being force fed thoughts by every single thing in System 2 specialist culture, you simply just try to make comparatively less entropic and more negentropic questions. Every 3 months, the winner gets the Least Stupid Prize. (System 1 people play Konsciousness Kombat, rave, trip and build Shi).

The key to being happily middle class is three-fold:

1. Simply just asking questions with less entropy over time.
2. Knowing how utterly irrational and insane humans are and treating it playfully.
3. Taking micronaps when you are tired.







Upcoming horror musical action movie -"Til We Gold : Insane, Irrational Poets and Puppets Saving Insane, Irrational Poets and Puppets (a film who's dialogue consists entirely of questions)"

In a race against preventable death, Peter and a ragtag group of poets and puppets attempt to save a bunch of poetic asses in danger without breaking TOO many rules ‚Äî and more importantly ‚Äî their stubborn, insane images of themselves and their absolutely weird and poetic quirks. 











































### "The Neurological is the Personal is the Political" Planetary Research Assemblage, 2024







**Elan Semiotechne's Idea of Negentropic Impact-based Consciousness:**

A definition of consciousness in which it is 100% verifiable only at a moment of bifurcation of planetary evolutionary flows towards more negentropic outcomes, given actual constraints, capacities and affordances. The processes deployed are circumstantial and not inherent to consciousness itself; sometimes they can be repeated, sometimes not.

##### Upcoming film: "@TilWeGold : The Impossible Embassy (We Have a Transnational Dream of the Amasian Biennale)"

Various irrational poets and artists race against preventable death, reductionism and regional entropy to save and be saved by other irrational poets and artists and build the hyperobject sculpture of the Transnational Dream of the Amasian Biennale, in the Decolonies of Amasia, New S.A., Postworkverse, and summon Shi the Dragon King, the unstoppable force of unconscious Good, made of past dead friends, present dead friends and future dead friends.

All of the dialogue is composed as critical questions and poetry, self-reflexive and open-ended conversations and naps, and cosmophysical karaoke, musical theater and hedonerdistic raves.

**@TilWeGold Film #FightDysrationalia Excerpt: Peter's Journey to The Center of the Taint to Meet the Psionically Powerful Anti-Cat-Pitalists and The Funky Dr. Quantumstein and Face His Dark Past, as A Stark Raving Mad, But Brilliant Zillenial Artist Who Almost Got Killed While Making Art Online**

In a sudden, but obvious twist of plot, Peter, outmatched by the Demons of Dysrationalia, must risk suicide and transformation into a murderous demon himself and venture into the Taint, the indeterminate zone between the supernatural asshole of the universe and its birth of an invagination.

He seeks the powerfully janky Grey Magiteks of Dr. Quantumstein, and psionically powerful Anti-Cat-Pitalists üò∫, trapped in the middle circles of Hell. 

Naturally, Peter encounters various alternate versions of Peter, some as a stark raving mad, but brilliant Zillenial artist making bat-shit insane art night and day for years after his graduation, so much so that he almost got killed for it by an actually insane person. Story to come.







##### "How far does Dysrationalia go? Watch the 'Act of Killing' ! Murder can be normalized to the point where you wake up, murder someone, eat brunch, nap, murder, go for a walk, murder, go party. Especially if you've got a massive state backing it legally, economically and culturally." Captain Amasia, 2024








Updating the hard problem of consciousness will basically prevent a crap ton of death and reboot the Humanities.

Clearly, everyone is not living in 2024 - they are in 1990s - 2000s!

Thank God we have alien doctors back from the ethical future of 2087 like me to do it!

##### "TilWeGold Story Core Conflict:

In the last possible year to turn the political tide and avert ecosocial collapse, can a ragtag band of 2024 Zillenials produce enough collective consciousness to break the 500 year-long World War 0 colonialist cycle of war, oppression and Dysrationalia Demonic Epidemic and summon Shi, the Dragon King, the Spirit of the Neganthropocene?"

**I can't be the only one who thinks it might behoove Trevor Paglen to stop poking at systems, culture and concepts he clearly is illiterate in and cannot resolve its conflicts**. Perhaps he should retire and go actually read some accurate philosophy, history and science before he gets himself killed, either by a spook, a criminal or just a mentally ill rando. 

**Just saying. That dude's fixin' to get himself disappeared.** Today's games are played ALOT dirtier than back in his day; he's way out of his depth. Just sayin' . **Kids will body ya for 700 bucks.

#### Draft for Peter's official artist biography:

Chongha Peter Lee, born November 17, 1987 in Madison, Wisconsin spent most of his early years in a dark, wet cave with several small feral wolverines, near his family's house, who abandoned him as soon as they saw that he could both eat food and summon high level Aeons.

For various reasons, the only things he had with him were a small TV, VHS recorder, VHS tapes, a Nintendo and an early IBM computer that ran games via DOS terminal commands.

It was in this environment that he honed his early media art trajectory, literally cutting his teeth on broken pieces of VHS cassettes, speaking in MS-DOS coding patterns and fingers twitching during dreams, timed perfectly to beat the last level of Mario.
