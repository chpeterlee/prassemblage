**What is the purpose of contemporary art of the 90's and 00's which produces snarls of open, irresolvable questions? 

It's a necessary cultural fixture for the economy of specialists, 17% of the population, to make regions function smoothly. Without it, regions fall apart. 

It's not adequate for planetary crisis intervention, but who cares! It's an adequate drug for certain ailments.

System 3: Zillenial Independent Ethical Hackers + AI + Peace Games + Affective Arbitrators + Press




Yes men lab.



2024 Political Strategy, accounting for the fact that the Left cannot possibly self-organize right now:

1. Elan Semiotechne will run for president as a self-aware insane person, promising only to do exactly whatever insane whim comes to their mind, as told to them by Shi the Dragon King, to critique the manipulation of the mentally ill in Right wing electoral politics.
2. Estamasia / Dr. Mousehelm will run for president as a Leftist puppet for the objectively best ideas, as opposed to Leftists with subjectively best ideas.
3. Captain Amasia / Han Jerry Larry will run for president as an Amasian Republican Theosopher of the Postworkverse.





**3 Most Important Political Battles This Year: Preventing Turkey's Ecosocial Collapse, Disorganizing the Fascist Right and Rallying the Zillenial Left.**

1. If Turkey succumbs to the Right or an earthquake, it will be game over - the Right will surge and wipe the totally incapacitated Left out, with only 6 years to irreversible climate change.
2. We have to go on the offensive and disorganize the Fascist Right.
3. Gotta rally the Zillenial Left, who have the skills, literacies and ethics to do 1 and 2.








For large-scale, rapid crisis interventions AI can be used to prevent specialists from making stupid decisions, particularly if they have cognitive impairments or articulation troubles - which could actually be the majority.

"Consciousness is Public Health is Political", Elan Semiotechne, 2024





 More than biopolitics, we need **bioMETRICALpolitics**. Quantitative measures of neurological and bodily health can easily objectively disqualify the extremist and mentally ill elements of the Right and also destructively inaccurate elements of the Left from occupying high impact positions and causing outsized damage. 
 We need an open culture of questioning, discussing and testing people, decisions and systems!
-- Elan Semiotechne







Fascism, racism and unjustifiable exclusion are not political positions; these are symptoms of mental illness and/or neurophysiological impairment.

Those exhibiting these symptoms should be diagnosed and treated humanely; **not argued with.**

-- Elan Semiotechne

#### "Healcelerationism" Elan Semiotechne, 2024

Co-opt the accelerationist culture which was co-opted by the extremist Right to accurately diagnose them all as mentally ill, which can be done by simply using public data.

The extremist Right is not a political movement, it's a public health crisis.

**"Healcelerationism", Elan Semiotechne, 2024**
1. Extreme Right is not a political movement, it's mental illness, and thus a public health crisis.
2. The Left is pretty good at self-diagnosis.
3. An actual accurate number of the mentally ill would be solid grounds for a postwork economy.
4. Open-ended art therapy is a necessary supplement for the mentally ill, doesn't matter what affiliation.
5. We can co-opt the co-opted accelerationist media culture.

#### What exactly is the point of the resource-intensive, mentally ill international artists? Is it not better if they are simply hospitalized? Asking for a friend.

-- Elan Semiotechne






There are 2 types of intellectuals today:

1. **Queer-eco-poets** who are on high speed trains towards totally preventable deaths.
2. **Polymath-ethical-hackers** who are simply trying to find a calm space on a ridiculous planet.









**Healcelerationism Psalm 4:17 (Give me professional care or give me preventable death)**
If one is neurophysiologically unstable, either of Left or Right positions, it is more important to seek adequate care and services and heal and gain balanced skills, than to engage in poorly constructed discourses, produced by neurophysiologically unstable individuals, who are at higher risk of dying preventable deaths.
-- Antifragile Agency AI, based on the texts of Elan Semiotechne, Shi the Dragon King and Taintlytics






**Healcelerationist Vible Psalm 4:17 (Demand Better Public Health Care; Public Health Can Be Used to Disqualify Decision-Makers)**
1. For every neurophysiologically imbalanced individual, Left or Right, there are 9 other individuals stabilizing them. 
2. Why not simply make public health labor THE point of politics?
3. Ecosocial discourses can be subsumed into public health by simply pointing out poor decision makers could be mentally ill.





Based on social media statements and circumstantial spot-checks, individuals' mental health conditions can be roughly inferred. This means poor high stakes decision-makers can be disqualified on the grounds of mental illness.

-- Elan Semiotechne 








**"2024 AI-Generated Artwork: a protocol for high-impact discourse in public (particularly for the mentally ill, irrational and unstable)"**
1. State your mental illnesses or if you have simply not been diagnosed yet, which makes rational discourse pointless.
2. State your unwavering irrational beliefs that will make complex discourse pointless.
3. State if you are in an unstable state and require social services, which makes other engagement pointless.






For reason-capable: Mental illness is made worse by engagement with information, discourse and debate; they need non-linguistic media and performance art therapy.

For reason-incapable: You'll have more friends and sex in non-linguistic media and performance art therapy, plus IT'S COOLER.

-- Antifragile Agency AI





"2024 Artwork: is that individual who is speaking on a high-impact subject:
1. Actually mentally ill and should be engaged in performance and media art therapy?
2. Or do they actually have the skill to produce accurate and inventive arguments that stand up to verification?"
Chongha Peter Lee, 2024






##### Antifragile Agency AI: why did the Left stagnate in the last 10 years and the Right surge? 
Because both have massive populations of mentally ill individuals. The Right weaponizes them, the Left cares for them but 80% ad hoc and inaccurately. Let's tackle this problem head on! It's a public health problem, not a rational public discourse.

Clearly, queerness and feminism are not mutually exclusive to skills, logic and accuracy. Alan Turing was queer; Hypatia was a total intellectual badass.

Then, lack of skills, logic and accuracy is an individual issue; deeper issues should be cared for by professionals.






Contemporary art is a blend of:
- Queer-eco-poetry.
- Minority-politics-absurdity.
- Pop-tech-playful games.

There is no space for synthesis, it's one or the other.








If we have large swathes of population who have zero interest in self-awareness, self-teaching and self-organizing, why bother? 

Better to simply play it like an instrument from afar.

**Teenology**: an epistemological method and political ideology based on an accurate assessment that the majority of modern societies are 13 years old with varying mental illnesses.

Mental illness is measured from a functionalist perspective, in relation to how much intentional or unintentional impacts are increasing preventable death, regional inequity and reductionist culture - not in terms of arbitrarily constructed and fleeting reactionary norms.









# Healightenment Hospital: a Heal-Up

For diagnosis and light treatment of those with low, medium or high intensity dyslexia, dyspraxia or dyscalculalia.

-- Elan Semiotechne 










Perhaps the majority of today's art production is simply expressions of individuals with some form of dyspraxia, dyslexia and dyscaculalia.

Why not identify and promote praxes that heal these ailments rather than exacerbate them?

-- Elan Semiotechne









It would make sense that much of the queer poetic scene actually stems from dyscalculalia (the inability to execute basic math operations) ... 

For example the definition of a hyperobject is so ridiculous that only someone who only thinks in language would entertain it.

-- Elan Semiotechne









Bottom line: the mentally ill need to be put in care, not in jobs. 

Paradoxically, this will also create an immense amount of jobs because of the immense amount of labor required to care for them. 

-- Elan Semiotechne 






A postwork economy can be simply built on public health care. 

There is an incredible amount of labor necessary to adequately treat the amount of ill and traumatized individuals existing today.

There is also a massive amount of invention and capital required to do so. Medical technology does not only encompass physical ailments; but also therapy, education and entertainment.

The Left is too incapacitated to self-organize and oppose the rising fascist Right; hence the only option is to simply fragment and disorganize the Right. 

To be honest, most of the actual Progressive implementations will come from older generations of the Left exiting its leadership positions but still being on call as consultants and second opinions per problem.

"Ozan Atalan and others will be doing the talking and making with the traumatized at Healceleration Hospital; Peter is exiting art, writing, filming and coding a future folk planetary fairy tale game that saves the planet." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024









**Mentally ill can perform their illnesses via art; get diagnosed; receive aid.** Due to the poor resourcing and undereducation of regions, almost 70%+ of adult individuals have some form of mental illness. For every 1 of these individuals, almost 9 trained individuals are required to stabilize them. Hence a postwork-industrial-complex is actually primarily a mental illness-industrial-complex - which makes sense to **invert capitalism to heal all the damage it causes, and point out its core problem.**
