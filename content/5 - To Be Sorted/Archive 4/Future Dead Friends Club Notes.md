Clearly, because of cognitive constraints, a rapid enlightenment is not going to occur. It will take 40 to 60 years. Forget education, the goal is simply to keep as many people alive as possible and neutralize harmful human expressions. 

There is way too little capacity for higher complexity paradigms at this time so they should be focused on zen, a chemically supplemented imagination and lo-fi means. This is enough to stop the crises. 
-- Dr. Dopeman








### Cultural Solution: zen, chemically augmented imagination, lo-fi methods.














4. Non-linguistic services - interior decorating and pure visual form services.
5. Observing and interpreting services.







Many use theory to escape from reality, not to function in reality.

This is worse than simply taking drugs; at least the drugs only temporarily confuse one's mind.

-- Elan Semiotechne







### "The Traumaconomy: Level 1, 2 and 3" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023












**Amasian Biennale Outline**

World:
- 6 years to ireversible climate change
- Rising wave of extremist fascism; the Left is too traumatized and has too many mental disorders for organizing the normal ways
- Stopping the Extremist Right will have to be done by independent ethical hackers. Everyone else should construct a service for the Traumaconomy.
Regions:
- Prevent preventable deaths, reduce reductionist culture, reduce crime from inequity.
- Media should be scoped for regional-scale health, business development and autodidactic subcultures.
- Philosophy: Zen, psychedelics, lo-fi aesthetics.
Individuals:
- Get diagnosed for dysrationalia due to trauma and tech acceleration.
- Get appropriate occupational therapy.
- Then participate in healing others' dysrationalia.




## "Autodidactic Sub-cultures: there are infinite, they will continue to multiply." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024
















If you're traumatized, accurately diagnose and address your trauma. For God's sake don't read theory, it's going to do more harm than good. Stay away from anything requiring function or logic.

Watch media art, play games, have fun. Learning is unnecessary until you are stable.

-- Elan Semiotechne 







Not accurately diagnosing an individual's dysrationalia up front costs them immense preventable pain, years of work and hundreds of thousands of dollars later for society.

-- Dr. Dopeman







The skills the Left doesn't have to organize the normal way, for 40-60 years:

1. Transcultural semiotic flexibility
2. Technological flexibility
3. Cosmophysical forensics

The best thing to do is to keep this in mind and build the Traumaconomy of healing the traumatized, by the traumatized.

-- Elan Semiotechne








##### "Diagnosing and Treating Trauma is a Pre-condition to Open-Ended, Complex Dialogue." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024








"**Ozan Atalan, aka Dr. Mousehelm**, approaches to address the good traumatized peoples' of the Decolonies of Amasia on building the Traumaconomy" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024








Those with dysrationalia hate coordinating with each other for whatever reason, even though they have the same exact problems. 

Makes sense because self-organizing requires MORE reason, not less.

Better to put them into workplaces.

-- Elan Semiotechne






Actual self-organizing requires way more complex and accurate reasoning and invention than working within a system. It's not for most.

When attempting to self-organize without reason, preventable death is the likely result.

Better for most to find a workplace and community, and quietly build a peaceful and happy life.

-- Elan Semiotechne





##### Why get your Dysrationalia (a mental disorder of having adequate intelligence but being unable to think and act rationally) treated by the ESTA-Certified Artistic Occupational Therapists of the Future Dead Friends Club?

1. It's not chemical, so it won't damage you permanently.
2. It's not traumatizing, so we won't put you in a worse condition; in fact you will be doing fun and weird media art therapy and might actually become famous and respected for your brave honesty!
3. Profits go primarily to saving a suicidal eco-queer Feminist and a physically dying man.
4. Thus, it empowers you, because instead of another cis white man saving your life AGAIN, now YOU save a man's life, and also your comrade.
5. If you don't treat it now, your dysrationalia will most likely grow worse and you will lose your individuality, your livelihood and possibly your life, costing everyone around you immense pain, time and money.







#### The dysrationalia disorder is the circumstantial inability to cognize open-ended options, actions and political dialogue given adequate intelligence.









##### Dysrationalia makes you more likely to become sick by malignant AI. Get checked now.














Dysrationalia is the biggest public health issue since the pandemic.

Many public officials have been affected, making statements born from mental disorders.

We will be deploying various AI to qualify various statements as either the result of the dysrationalia mental disorder or otherwise.

-- Elan Semiotechne

"Open call for mentally ill to leave politics and help act and produce in amazing horror movie, 1000x cooler and more fun than boring politics, which is extremely boring."

-- Jean Godammard, famous workhorse director






1. **Queer-eco-poets**: get diagnosed for dysrationalia, work in psychoanalysis and fashion, stay away from planetary infrastructure and impact.
2. **Independent-ethical-hackers**: make a ton of money, absurdist media and unprecedented pranks.

-- Elan Semiotechne 








**Why is culture so f--king stupid today?**
1. Neoliberal capitalism absolutely destroyed balanced incentive and risk systems 40 years ago.
2. Public education undereducates 70% of the individuals passing through it; private education doesn't properly screen individuals for mental illnesses.
3. As a result there is a massive amount of individuals with mental illnesses floating around, mostly undiagnosed, f--king everything up, especially the 1%.
-- Elan Semiotechne






##### Why are even our f--king academics literally f--king clinically insane today?
Private education doesn't provide adequate mental evaluations for its students; hence many grow up skilled in one thing but absolutely traumatized as f--k and psychologically mutilated. This pays dividends down the road as suicide or absolutely irresponsible batsh-t insane breakdowns, outbursts and criminal misconduct.
