Zill Pill - hard pill to swallow




 **Elan Semiotechne's Grandiose and Self-aware, Insane, Transgressive Theory of Consciousness as System 1, System 2 and System 3** (I DARE TO TYPIFY YOUR INSANITY ACCURATELY AND OPEN-ENDEDLY LIKE AN INSANE ASSHOLE! ðŸ¤ª )

We can divide the population into 3 categories:

**System 1:** 71% of the population, the Postworking Class, does not have enough extended memory, cultural support or economic incentive to engage in a society of symbols. Thus, the primary mode of navigating reality is the **Unconscious Stomach-Space Relation.** 

**System 2a (8.5%) and System 2b (8.5%):** 17% of the population, specialists, does not have enough time, organized autodidactic curriculums and events to develop into independent ethical hackers and polymath acrivists. System 2a learns via **Subconscious Kino-Sonic relations** and System 2b learns via **Subconscious Visual-Logic relations.**

**System 3 (11%)**: these are autodidactic, independent ethical hackers and polymath activists. Today's socio-economies don't yet have the language, audience and transactions to support these people. They learn via **Conscious Perspectival-Statistical** inferences.

People who aren't traumatized and can make art, where art thou?




- Some people are so subjugated that they cannot form an independent thought.
- Some people die without knowing what it means to live.
- Some people spend decades of their life trying to answer a question about themselves, the planet and reality.
- Some people get killed during the process of learning.
- Some get it, heal the planet, and live peacefully.







##### Without more flexible and accurate culture, people are on a high speed train heading off of a cliff. 

Lack of ability to negotiate will cause relationships to implode and psychosis will grow; dying alone, miserable and full of regrets is a very likely possibility.

Get a consult from the Future Dead Friends Club from people who are physically dying, spiritually alive. They save your inner life, you save their physical life.







#### "Amasian Biennale: Occupy Occupational Therapy" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024
All the extremists from Left and Right have some variety of dyslexia, dyscalculalia or dyspraxia; all they need is a bit of occupational therapy to get over a specific hurdle in their life. That will defuse the larger stupidity of politics that they are projecting everything on to.








##### "It is objectively worse to be traumatized and rewarded than it is to be traumatized and in proper treatment and less rewarded. Society's toys mean nothing in comparison to health. Being rewarded for being mentally ill and clearly heading for suicide/murder is one of the worst circles of Hell. See what happened to Basquiat? Go get professional help." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024







Art programs and spaces need to be screened by occupational therapists for at-risk individuals who don't have the basic minimum skills to function as individuals in society.

These individuals should be in a separate program to build up fundamental skills - it is traumatizing for them to be in the same curriculum. They can simply just go through the more complex program later.

-- Elan Semiotechne 







"If you are traumatized, don't teach others. 

Get professional occupational therapy, and anyone you are helping, direct them to professional occupational therapy." Dr. Dopeman, 2024
