**Data scraped from Children's Intelligence Agency operator, Kid Zero's Pure Game playthroughs** (a reference to Deleuze): What could the Global Middle ACTUALLY do today (because as of 2024, it is too underskilled and underresourced to save the planet directly)

1. The Global Middle is way too deskilled and underresourced to ACTUALLY save the planet. If it tried, it would kill more people than it would save.
2. The planet is self-balancing regardless, out of the control of any single possible entity. It will probably take 60 years to reach a statistically defined balanced state.
3. Okay! So basically that leaves trying to save as many lives as possible in the meantime. 
4. The biggest asset the Global Middle has stems from its weakness - its incapacity to coordinate is due to its immense complexity and diversity. 
5. Ironically, simply producing an accurate portrait of the Global Middle and its incapacities would reduce all the extremism of both the Right and the Left, because it would be clear how little control and capacity any particular entity has - **and the only possible strategy is to clear the communication channels and allow the better options to emerge!**






"Place Your Bets Artwork, No. 3995 by Kid Zero, Children's Intelligence Agency Operator:

An accurate portrait of the sheer stupidity, incapacity and widespread mental illnesses of the planet would clear up the misunderstanding that 99.9% of humans could possibly control it. 

Thus, the obvious course of action would emerge as the better option: chilling the f--k out, understand it will take about 60 years for the planet to reach balance and then planning accordingly."

# Kid Zero's Ch.I.A. report: 

Learning requires safety and time; it doesn't require teachers or leaders. 

The best teachers and leaders know this and leave autonomous individuals to self-teach and self-organize.

If an individual is not autonomous, they should be assisted by professionally trained aid personnel, most likely occupational therapists; not engaging in programs of independent study.

### "Place Your Bet No. 3364:

**Conceptual Art is for Cultural Discourse With Independent Individuals; Therapy is for Therapy, Which is Better in Groups Sometimes. Mixing and Matching is a Recipe for Disaster.**

However, you could have cultural discourse and therapy in the same space, you just have to divide the function by individual."

I am no more than a mere mortal such as you (albeit with a slightly larger clatch of semiotechnical skills spanning across domains and endeavors, which can be confirmed on a case-by-case basis, most likely by **Taintlytics**)."
