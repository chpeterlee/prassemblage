##### Contemporary art sucks at saving the planet and it's not going to change much quickly, and there's nothing at stake; what is it good at?
1. It's pretty decent at regional organizing - **but you should get paid for it! By your region!**
2. **More importantly, it makes for much more interesting dinner conversations and dates.**
3. Basically, all the payoff in contemporary art comes from poetic skill. Making physical objects for contemporary art is idiotic. **The entire art of contemporary art is hanging out and bullshitting! The fuck are we living in, fucking ancient Egypt, we need fucking giant physical temples to store objects for cultural memory? Lol.







##### Because 100% of the function of contemporary art is discursive and not impact-based, then by definition, the more semiotechnically skilled an artist is, the more range of expression, accuracy and open-endedness.

Easy peasy test to objectively value an artist in contemporary art! You simply measure them by process, or skill, rather than by product.









##### Contemporary art is the skill and craft of modelling and sustaining transregionalist discourse at a regional scale, easily comparative, quantifiable and payable. 

##### In the near future, in 10-20 years, it's simply going to be absorbed into governmental organizations as "Regional Social Modelling". That's all!






## Post-contemporary art, 21st Century Art, is impact-based art and planetary-scale evolution.

You simply just measure 21st Century Art by its impact on the planet's evolution. 

It's ridiculously, childishly direct and simple. **YES YOUR KID COULD DO IT AND NOT ONLY THAT - SHOULD REALLY BE DOING NOTHING ELSE.**

**20th Century art is accuracy-phobic; 21st Century art is NOT - but it is 100% anti-reductionist!**

# To Do:

1. Stick all the batsh-t insane contemporary artists and specialists into regional modelling. Stabilize them into the Modelseum sandbox, never, ever come back, only talk to them via AI **unless it's for footage for a mockumentary.**

2. **Only work with non-traumatized and intelligent individuals, mainly youth, on the Least Stupid 13 movie, and wreak havoc on the planet using 21st Century tech and culture.**

##### The Catch-22 of Contemporary Art by Kid Zero, Director of the Children's Intelligence Agency: 
If you make well-structured and semiotechnically skilled conceptual artwork, you attract a literally clinically insane audience who need therapy and aid, not discourse, **and interact with an artwork as a drug, not part of a peer conversation.**

**The long-term solution: 
1. **Give people good drugs, not bad drugs.** 
2. Connect them with aid, therapy and service organizations.
3. Automate an invisible support infrastructure and permanently exit contemporary art.




##### "Place Your Bets No. 637 by Kid Zero of the Children's Intelligence Agency
The answer to contemporary art:
1. Good drugs
2. Good cinema
3. Good parties
Limits: any new paradigm shifts take like 1 year for a contemporary art educated person to absorb. 

**Contemporary artists are not the best and brightest; they are slackers, stoners and nerds.** They are in art for good drugs and not-bad ideas, not good ideas and real impact. If they wanted good ideas and impact, they'd just teach themselves all the skills!" Kid Zero, 2024





## Contemporary art is a community of good-hearted regional üê¢ , not accurate polymath eagles ü¶Ö . Contemporary artists need turtle parties, cinema and healthy drugs! Eagles need play, complexity and novelty!

Payoff: cosplay as anything, take healthy drugs with people who won't kidnap and kill you!

### Excerpt from Dr. Hao's ethical future medical journal:
1. Not being able to do math, logic and ethically negotiate with others **is similar to not being able to smell, taste or hear.**
2. **You are not a lesser being because your body does not have these senses;** you are simply tuned for other behaviors and ecosystem niches. 
3. Fish are better at swimming than birds; birds are better at flying than fish. One could transform into another, but it would take at least thousands of years and intense energy, work and pain.
4. That being said, it's a better use of your time to clearly state the senses you don't have and the ecosystem niche that will kill you - and enjoy developing senses that you do have, or also COULD develop and **build a niche that will NOT kill you!**




### "Place Your Bets No. 365 by Kid Zero:

Contemporary Art in 2024 is a game of building and connecting region-scale niches - NOT a game of planetary paradigm shifts. 

Contemporary artists are friendly turtles üê¢ , not high-speed eagles ü¶Ö. " 

Kid Zero, 2024
