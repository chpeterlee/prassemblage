Most of today's population, including its high-impact administrators and individuals, simply have some form of trauma, and/or learning disability and/or mental illness. 

That's what the majority of today's social media output is! 2024 is 60 years away from a healthy society â€” which is unconsciously being built, outside the control of any single entity. 

Live accordingly!
