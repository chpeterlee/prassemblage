What is sane in what context, and how can we judge specific claims?

###### "20th Century Culture in a One-line 21st Century Artwork: A few people synthesizing core theoretical paradigms, some more people translating it into art and various non-art cultural forms, everyone else being exhausted from sh-tty working conditions and not caring or understanding. It takes 100 years for a widespread information economy to develop." Chongha Peter Lee, 202r




1. Most of the population is simply trapped in neurophysiologically imbalanced cycles.
2. This means that we have to throw out every culture that would work on healthy individuals. **Rational discourse is not going to work, nor is teaching humans skills in an age of YouTube; it's far too late for most. The problem isn't conceptual-cultural, it's psycho-chemical.**
3. This leaves 3 things: encourage people to chill the Hell out, cook healthy food and nap. **There is no proactive advice that's worth giving because it would require accurate reasoning and interpretation.** 








**The only possible cultural model that can work today is that of the birthday party.**

In 2087, when there's a swarm of AI historians thoroughly grading the objective stupidity, incompetence and lack of imagination at the level of individual synapses, there will be a sudden convulsion of laughter rippling across the planet as they realize that in 2024, **everyone basically had an interdimensional communications and supercomputer device in the form of an affordable smartphone, AI and laptop, and they could barely order pizza with it.**" , Kid Zero, Children's Intelligence Agency Analyst, 202





### "Neganthropocene Summit Conceptual Art Scavenger Hunt Project: Place Every Possible Solution to Every Possible Problem on Earth in 2024 Just 1 Google Search or ChatGPT Query Away" Dr. Hao, 2024

##### "Upcoming - the @AmasianBiennale ultimate conceptual performance artwork of mass Dysrationalia: 

freely transact drugs, sex and triviality online, call art and cultural discussion traumatizing; **get diagnosed via AI and put on a list so people don't bother you with actual critical discussions requiring a degree of psychosocial stability and competence**; you happily continue onwards on your trajectory, best wishes." Antifragile Agency AI, 2024
