1. In the next 6 years, 80-90% of the existing art world will be steered towards rebooting the #GlobalMiddle . **Full planetary self-balancing will probably not occur until at least 2087.** 
2. The actual future of art, the Humanities, the Sciences and academia at large will be in **Impact-based Humanities, Sciences and Academia**. A new generation of informational institution which will be focused on modelling, architecting and modulating actual real-world impacts. 
3. This will form an economic layer which will later be called **System 3** - **the Impact economy**. Maybe 11% of today's existing modernized populations are equipped for operating in a small capacity in **System 3.** 
4. At least 89% of today's academics, entrepreneurs and engineers operate in System 2, which is specialized knowledge production, specialized industry and specialized engineering; **it would take world peace and billions of dollars to upgrade them,** produce cultural campaigns educating the rest of the public and also re-tooling various governmental and community structures."

# "Place Your Bets no. 327 by Kid Zero: re-define contemporary art as simply trans-regional cultural hangouts rather than as conceptually complex and rigorous production spaces.

1. It is way better to rebrand "contemporary art" as **trans-regional cultural and experience production.** 
2. The core of what contemporary art used to be, a place for rigorous public theoretical discussion and synthesis, has totally collapsed. There's nobody with enough skill in the field to do this anymore.
3. **Right now, it's primarily semiotically and technically unskilled individuals producing second-hand and trivial output. Totally fine, just call it what it is!" Children's Intelligence Agency, 2024
