# The 6th Learning Disability: Dystition

The learning disability of interpreting the past, present and adjacent possible to rapidly ontologize a verifiably inaccurate view of a problem and solution, then acting and projecting unconsciously, subconsciously and consciously an overly optimistic or cynical view of the past, present and adjacent possible.

#### Ethical Future Tube: a videostreaming platform so far ahead of its time that it has literally time travelled back from the ethical future of 2087, and only creates, curates and rates content from those ethical future perspectives, because everything else is so unbelievably boring.

# How to #GlobalMiddle :

1. 3 transdisciplinary art projects for everyone to hang out in.
2. Define various learning disabilities and personality types (stoner, slacker and nerd) and the common ground - everyone is as mature as a 13 year old with one solid specialist skill.
3. Make a film of an army of psychosocial workers, occupational therapists and legal/career advisors impersonating the future dead selves of the #GlobalMiddle and voicing accurate critiques through children.

#### Upcoming as 1/3 of the 6th Element: The Amasian Fist and The Poised Realm

Chongha Peter Lee performs as Dr. Hao; a time-travelling media archaeologist and superpositional shaman back from the Ethical Futures Institute of 2087.

He arrives on the streets of 2024 with various pieces of affordable survivable gear anyone could pick up with less than a week of simple work or begging.

His only way home is to actualize an ethical future fairy tale in which him and the people reboot the #GlobalMiddle through a transregionalist art exhibition!
