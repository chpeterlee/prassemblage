#### Casting Call for #Postworkstock Contemporary Art Reality TV Show Challenge as part of the Amasian Biennale:

Unlike the real world, the more psychosocially unstable, deskilled and socially inept you are, the more you will be rewarded (with artistic currencies) and the less you will harm others, because all your crazy will be going into the safe space of art, not destroying things in the real world.

**Whomever saves the world first wins; whomever commits unjustified violence to themselves or others first, loses!**









"90's-00's Contemporary Art praxes and theory are simply trans-regionalist mediation and forensic frameworks. **You will never get paid making Contemporary Art and neither will you be able to pay all the people that work for you.**

Contract for regional impact and modelling groups; then you will be paid. 

Otherwise, you are screwing yourself and everyone who works for you, plus you're just making a bunch of zero impact productions." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024.





## Autodidactic Feminism, from the Book of Light:

It is Feminist to self-teach oneself to polymath level semiotechnical skills, such as Hypatia of Alexandria did as well as various indigenous female astronomers.

The contextual incapacity of an individual to self teach can be attributed to demonic possession by the **White Devil of Dysrationalia**, who feeds on fracturing thought processes through faster-than-light media processes.

#### "If you can hack today you can take over a region single-handedly. What's the point of learning any other skill, unless you simply have some form of mental illness?" Kid Zero, Director of the Children's Intelligence Agency, 2024








## There is paradigm-shifting art and non-paradigm-shifting art. **In 2024, Contemporary art is non-paradigm-shifting art.**
##### Around 2016, Contemporary Art began to mean psychotherapy, occupational therapy and regionalism, rather than paradigm shifting intellectualism, invention and infrastructure. 

-- Kid Zero, Children's Intelligence Agency






#### There is art that produces evolutionary paradigm shifts at the planetary scale, and there is art that does not - aka culture.

##### In 2016, Contemporary Art ceased to produce new evolutionary paradigm shifts at planetary scale; it transformed into regional culture and development services.

It is similar to saying blacksmithing is an art today. Yes, it takes lots of skill and has a certain amount of impact - but it is not producing a new evolutionary paradigm shift today at planetary scale. **Also to note, most of today's planetary scale ideas are like over 50 years old.**




## Toxic Dysrationalia:

The underlying mental disorder that produces both toxic masculinity and toxic fragility (when an entity performs and executes a behavior that will unnecessarily destroy it or destroy others, forcing an unnecessarily  massive amount of labor, energy and time to be expended to prevent an entropic outcome).
