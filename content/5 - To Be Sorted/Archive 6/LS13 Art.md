##### "Recommendation Letters, Disrecommendation Letters and the I-Have-Little-Personal-Experience-to-Judge-From-But-Others-Might-Have-More-Experience Letters Conceptual Art Project by Chongha Peter Lee: 

Make an honest recommendation letter for Chongha Peter Lee of things he saved your ass and possibly life for, and make a disrecommendation letter for things you directly got in a fight with him about and things you personally have little person experience to judge him about, but others might, about what he's doing, saying and thinking.

Thus, the recommendation letter itself maps an accurate portrait of how silo'd experience, knowledge and skills actually are in the field of contemporary art, how little actual transparent cross-evaluation there is, so that we can draw practical and beneficial constraints around and clearly delineate what it can and can't do **so that less people commit suicide, f--k each other over and simply just f--k each other badly.** 

Classic critical contemporary artwork form and content!", Chongha Peter Lee, 2024






### "The Modelseum Hall of Fame: all the absurd fights about purely abstract models people have been in. The most ridiculously intense and trivial abstract fight wins the prize." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024




## "üì∞ Breaking News From Postwork TV: 
Ethical future authorities have combed through Chongha Peter Lee's knowledge vault and have ascertained 3 things:
1. **He's probably been in more diverse and complex abstract model fights in the Modelseum in the last 10 years than any individual in history**. His bet that the planet will take about 60 years to mature to self-balance is accumulating more and more support by researchers.
2. He was a foundational operator of the Children's Intelligence Agency. He saved numerous people from death, suicide, exile, ruin and unhappiness, and he attributed all his deeds to various angelic alien spiritual possessions, such as Captain Amasia and Estamasia. 
3. He is fond of eclectic dancing and music, literature and philosophy and his solution to the hard problem of consciousness accurately diagnosed the majority of both Humanities and Science academics and most of the public with various forms of Dysrationalia, dystition and other learning disabilities and cognitive disorders, exacerbated primarily by poorly controlled electronic media consumption habits." Postwork TV, 2024



### "Place Your Bets No. 217 by Children's Intelligence Agency Counter-psy-ops Semiotech, Kid Zero:

Electronic media's light speed tempo and semiotic disjunctures is what caused so many various forms of Dysrationalia.

Dysrationalia encompasses many learning disabilities and perceptual disorders in varying intensities, including what earlier professionals called ADHD." Kid Zero, 2024

##### "Place Your Bets No. 553 by Ch.I.A. Counter Psy-Ops Officer Kid Zero:
Is @ChonghaPeterLee the only artist alive with enough semiotic and technical skill to accurately mock contemporary art while also advancing it into the ethical future with respect to its past and demystifying it to the point that even your mom can make a smart investment in it? ALL SIGNS POINT TO YES." Kid Zero, 2024
