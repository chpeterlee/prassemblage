1. We do not have a Humanities of 2087, which is capable of polymath intellectualism and invention and actually saving the planet; **we also don't have a Humanities of the 15th Century, where if you said something interesting, you'd be burned ðŸ”¥ at the stake.**
2. The Humanities that we DO have in 2024 **is made of** **3 things; stoners, slackers and nerds, who all have the maturity of 13 year olds.**
3. As such, thank God that all the technocultural systems undergirding human society have their own trajectory towards self-balance. **If the fate of the planet ACTUALLY depended on coherent directed human action, we'd be FUCKED.**
4. All world-saving stuff is now out of the way, and all regional balancing stuff can simply just be automated. This leaves the question - **what can today's Humanities' ACTUALLY have impact on that won't drive them to suicide or unintentionally murdering others?**
5. They can do neighborhood-level fundraising and organizing, regional-scale media art exhibitions and parties of interesting cosmopolitical stuff and lightly collaborate between public-sector non-profits and the media.  **Why not enjoy doing what we actually can rather than getting depressed about systems that are balancing themselves?**















## What is 2024 Humanities actually?

Stoners, slackers and nerds who are eternally 13 years old. My favorite!

##### Children's Intelligence Agency Report No. 357 by Kid Zero: The past, future, and present of the Humanities 
1. **In the past**, you'd simply be exiled, imprisoned and murdered for saying anything interesting.
2. **In the future**, everyone in the Humanities will have the skills and capabilities of a polymath inventor and each will be able to save the planet by simply hacking it.
3. **In the present:** **90% of the Humanities is made of stoners, slackers and nerds who are as mature as 13 year olds** (which I like). In this situation, there's only a few things that can be done. 
4. Neighborhood level organizing and fundraising, regional regulation exhibitions, and media arts based speculative practices and theory.
5. The actual planet will be fine, its systems are on a trajectory of self-balance, beyond any single perspective's control - so this means **people should just** **enjoy doing what they can, not committing suicide over what they can't!**
