### Upcoming: Neganthropocene Summit Protocols
1. **If you are psychosocially unstable, we suggest not to participate without a thorough psychosocial evaluation beforehand and a set of safety measures and safety net.** Unstable individuals will be redirected to audience, commentator and performance roles (**particularly in the System 2 Amasian Biennale and System 1 Democraseum art platforms**), not onboarded into speculative producer systems.
2. Your health and security is more important than speculative knowledge production and it is your and various NGO's responsibility to deliver aid, support and advising to you; the Neganthropocene Summit cannot provide you with these services and is not responsible for them. 
3. There will be open source protocols for valuing, registering and transacting various products and processes of speculative production, modelling and impacts.

##### Neganthropocene Summit Entry Psychosocial Screening Game no. 486 (aka the Dysrationalia Captcha)

##### Answer this riddle: why are human eyes on the front of the human head and not on our butts? Why did they come to be this way and how could this change in the future?

Depending on your answer, you will either be:
1. Redirected to aid, therapy and advising.
2. Engaging in participatory frameworks, autodidactic sandboxes and speculative games.
3. Contributing to collective knowledge production and infrastructure.





#### "Excerpt from Dr. Hao's ethical future history textbook of 2024: Death of the entropic is a true natural law; survival of the fittest is not.

1. Entropic systems are at higher risk of death; this is a true natural law. Later, by 2087, death itself will just be redefined as varying configurations of the system state of entropy.
2. Survival of the fittest is clearly not always the optimal solution in many ecologies - such as plants which survive through immense amounts of mediation, communication, complementary assemblages and technically 'unfit' states. 
3. Sometimes, cooperation is a much more successful strategy in some environments and at certain times than others. Definitely not all environments at all times!
4. Hence it is accurate to say that death of the entropic is a true natural law; survival of the fittest is not.
5. If someone needs to articulate an accurate evolutionary law - we can just say "evolution is negentropic." Then, whatever strategy, whether competitive or cooperative produces appropriately induce negentropic processes and system states within constraints, is accurate." Dr Hao, 2024







##### "Neganthropocene Summit Conference of BetterOptions.Art: 
Me talking with your mom or grandmom about Amasia, the neo-Pangea currently in formation. I will also sing the Amasian anthem with them, and rap, breakdance, play poetry games and help open bottles and get stuff out of the cupboards, while wearing crazy tech wear + wizard clothes. We can make a mockumentary also, if she's down for it." **Chongha Peter Lee as Dr. Hao, 2024**






###### "Place Your Bets No. 437 by Kid Zero: Contemporary art was art in 90's-00's. It's not art in 2024! It's simply healthy trans-regionalist media and forensics culture.
1. It is better to just rebrand "Contemporary Art" into **20th Century trans-regionalist cultural production** rather than keep mistakenly calling it art!
2. **Contemporary Art was art in 1990's-2000's ; it's not art in 2024!** It's necessary infrastructure! Get paid properly for it!
3. There's 2024 art, but it takes so much semiotic and technical skill that probably less than 100 people on Earth can possibly make it!" Kid Zero, 2024

## "Place Your Bets No. 886 by Kid Zero - aka, 'the last possible contemporary art project': 

Bet on whether Peter will lose his soul to the devil in a wager that he has a model that can save the planet before it collapaes.

To be judged by Dr. Hao and various angels and aliens and AI.
