If objectively valuable art was not possible, a common object that more than 1 person perceives and talks about could not exist; hence, an alphabet could not exist, sculptures could not exist, exhibitions could not exist; additionally, the fact that Peter literally has to state this in 2024 shows how much of the population is simply mentally ill, has a learning disability or requires some type of neurochemical balancing preventing them from being able to enter a rational critical discourse across domains of knowledge and experience; **take the good drugs, not the shitty drugs**", Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

### Excerpt from the Antifragile Agency computational analysis report for the Hirschhorn Museum:

1. **90's-00's era contemporary art is not a paradigm shift today;** it is an integral and necessary part of regional development, modelling and infrastructure. 

2. Instead of fighting for invisible shows in small art spaces with unpaid interns, students and volunteers, get funded by your cities and regional organizations for delivering quality regional models, services and projects. **Even for fun stuff like raves and psychedelics!**

3. **Today's paradigm-shifting art comes in 3 forms:** whitepapers and technical diagrams, computational/physical models and data points/materials with capacities.
