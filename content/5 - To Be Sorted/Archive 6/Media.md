#### Excerpt from Dr. Hao, time traveller from the Poised Realm on what is primarily at stake in social media:

1. Social media clearly is not like film or TV, which have legal regulations.
2. Most of the population has some type of trauma, learning disability or is dealing with broken infrastructure.
3. Hence, there's like a 70% chance any given social media output will simply just be the byproduct of trauma, mental illness or catastrophe.
4. That being the case, what social media becomes more about is articulating 3 things:
- Trauma and mental illness should be professionally treated, not f--ked around with.
- Broken systems should be fixed via governmental systems; individuals should organize to demand it; best to do it at regional scale.
- There's a plethora of non-profit, non-governmental and community organizations who have entire staffs of people to deliver the services people really need - all a Google search or ChatGPT question away. Which was not the situation in 1920 - people would most likely just be stuck somewhere and ignored to die.

### Excerpt from the 6th Element: Fist of Amasia and Other Sundries of The Poised Realm ethical future fairy tale by Dr. Hao, time travelling academic, Postworking Class action hero and dive bar poet:

**It is much more important for you to find enough happiness to not commit suicide and pre-emptively defuse other would be murderers.** Leave bigger and more complex fights to aliens, angels and genius children. Also, use media to help them make movies about it!

It behooves a statistical majority of humans to fight and live in the 21st Century and make peace with the 20th and pre-20th Centuries ways of life; it is not advisable for those of the 20th Century and pre-20th Century to attempt to suppress the 21st, because it will not only probably kill you, it will turn your children against you also. 

Also, probably not advisable to attempt to transition quickly into the 21st; it's like trying to walk into space without a space suit.

Those of the 20th and pre-20th Century should find pockets of the world and of each other that will leave them in peace. Do not bother fighting a bigger fight; only do what is minimally necessary to defend you and your own.
