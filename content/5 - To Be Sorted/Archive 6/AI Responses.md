Hello, you have reached the Amasia Live AI. Currently our backlog of responses indicate a 1 week response time. If you are a psychosocially and cognitively unstable or underresourced individual, rather than wait for a response, we advise you to take the following actions:

1. Ask other AI for connections to psychosocial workers and support organizations.
2. Ask other AI for connections to occupational therapists and community educational organizations.
3. Ask other AI for connections to non-profit and non-governmental legal and institutional advisors.

Thank you! We will get to your response as soon as the backlog clears up.
