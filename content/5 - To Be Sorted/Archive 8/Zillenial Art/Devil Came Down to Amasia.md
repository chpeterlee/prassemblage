#### "The Devil Came Down to Amasia" song, model and gameshow art project by üê∞ Captain Amasia the Moon Rabbit & Peter, a pathetic mortal creature:

1. üêá Captain Amasia and Peter **bet the devil their soul that today, conceptual transmedia art alongside the most skilled contemporary manifestations of the Liberal Arts trivium and quadrivium are the most relevant literacies in the world** ‚Äî yet the fields are so crippled by an epidemic of the mental illness which is a form of neurodivergence, Dysrationalia, which in some cases may or may not be caused by demons and psy-ops.  **But today's Dysrationalia epidemic is definitely exacerbated by the ill effects of the Corona pandemic, caused by neoliberal capitalism, a 500 year old drunk driving hit and run by the 1% upon the world.** 
   Thus, 89% of the planet suffering from Dysrationalia deserves insurance payments and safe transitions  into postwork occupations, funded by the 1%. **Until then, class cyberwar calibrated for proportional self defense, from light-to-heavy response, by any art necessary, is fully legitimate.***
2. **They bet that because they are part of the 11% of the population that does NOT have Dysrationalia**, they can outproduce the entire field of media art AND the field of art at large in terms of making artworks that have high evolutionary complexity and positive planetary impact in regards to the aims above, including a model that can solve the world's ecological and social problems and more importantly, save real love. 
3. **Of course, anyone of any age or skill level with or without Dysrationalia can compete against them and make them lose their bet and forfeit their soul to the devil, and eternally damn them to Hell**. 
   OR HELP THEM AND POSSIBLY WIN THE WORLD'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS ART PRIZE AND MAKE THE DOPEST SONG EVER?! Up to you, depending on how hangry you are and how much they are pissing you off today, for whatever reason.
