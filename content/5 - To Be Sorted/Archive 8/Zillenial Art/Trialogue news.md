## Up next: organizing across regions to regulate your region's housing, jobs, education, health, justice systems and living costs.



#### "Clearly, anyone having large negative impacts on your housing, jobs, education, health, justice systems and living costs in your region has a mental health issue and needs to be decommissioned and treated for their and others' safety." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024



##### "Objectively, the majority of contemporary artists are not world-class hackers or polymaths and can't save the planet; but they are skilled enough for fixing regional systems of health, education, housing and â€” also fixing bad vibes!. 

##### We are going to have the Postworkverse Regionalympics, regional hackathon competitions, fashion shows, Model Kombat, exorcisms and bets featured on PostworkTV.art, Amasia.live and Fox2.live" Han Jerry Larry, 2024
