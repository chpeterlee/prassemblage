    # Satire of AI, Artists, Academics, Corporations, Government, Youth, Mystics, Nature




###### "We are 60 years away from retraining academies and art markets to output inclusive, accurate and impactful academics and artists; in the meantime, they can promote lo-fi autodidacticism / Dysrationalia awareness, healthy party games and interpassive proxy automated activism. That's all for 60 years! 

###### For 89% of academics and artists, expect zero self-organizing, zero accuracy and zero impact. For them, staying alive another day is hard enough!" üêà Dr. Catpatia Piper, 2024





# Escape From Dysrationalia Game:

1. Make a physical or digital escape room from Dysrationalia.
2. Make a horror movie about it.
3. Chain your physical or digital production together as an exquisite corpse with other; also if you want, connect solutions together with other like an exquisite corpse, or Frankentein, by simply hashtagging it #EscapeFromDysrationalia .
