    ----- SUPPORT THYSELF: ![üêá](https://discord.com/assets/9d739dd467a9e30863ba.svg) Captain Amasia's advice: If you are of the 71% heavily neurodivergent, stay away from the violent neurodivergent. Focus on physical skills and 1 on 1 therapy games. Use XR and VR, don't engage in symbolics. Find a mentor, a shelter and an NGO. If you are of the 17% mildly neurodivergent, form mutual aid networks. Use pop trash culture to communicate, not anything requiring rigor. Produce anti-1% and upper middle class media. If you are of the 11% non-neurdivergent and skilled, form teams of bounty-hunters to contract to build life support, postwork and automated justice systems. (edited)

    5. 3 rules of class cyberwar by Captain Amasia
    
    - Everything functional will be automated ; Media will be kid-friendly, playful, pop-speculative art ; Regional regulation of housing, education and health targeting individuals of the upper middle class operating the 1%'s corporations will be done via regional press outlets.
    
    ### 
    
    6. Hit 3 spots:
    
    - Gamespaces/Church/StreetFashion ; Film/conceptual art/11% transregional galleries & news ; Whitepaper/Automation/SFI
    
    ### 
    
    7. Concepts:
    
    - Ecosocial function -> energy entropy/negentropy -> Mountain, Grid, Manifold paradigm.
    - Peace Gaming -> Postwork automation -> Non-linear Attractors
    - Info -> Death -> Violence : Cyber-bullying / Grief / Radicalization & Info-war (inaccurate mental maps & models)
    
    ### 
    
    8. Phase Out:
    
    "A List of Ideologies, Systems and Behaviors that Were Okay in 20th Century Art, Science and Cultural Paradigms Due to Their Limits - But Are Not Okay in 2024, Due to New Paradigms of Knowledge, Systems and Behaviors. In About 10 Years or Less, People Will Start Going to Jail For This Stuff." POSTWORKVERSE, 2024

### "Impact-based Representational Politics" üêà Catpatia Piper, 2024

Instead of having the utterly boring, fragile, suicidal notion of 20th Century representative politics of "put-your favorite-minority-mascot-at-volume-11-until-they-commit-suicide", **imagine an accurately computed amount of visibility and network allocation that minimizes risks to their health and also maximizes negentropic impact on society.**

(Basically, 20th Century Art was the story of driving mentally ill individuals into public suicide. Those people should be indicted!)

Empirical phenomena correlating information to mental health and suicide/death:

1. Cyber bullying - inducing entropic chemical loads.
2. Grief - inducing entropic chemical loads.
3. Radicalization - constructing inaccurate mental maps which lead individuals to violence.
