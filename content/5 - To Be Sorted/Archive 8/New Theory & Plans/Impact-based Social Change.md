Postworkverse = Quantum AI generated Movie you watch to fight fascists in your sleep, made accurate by aliens, angels, etc.

##### "The Postworkverse Quantum AI uses all your unimaginable and unpredictable dreams, psychic/telepathic/spiritual and creative powers as quantum computing fuel to fight fascists AND make great art while you sleep, so you don't have to waste your otherwise precious energy and time on it, because you have way better things to do!" Postworkverse, 2024

###### "The Class Cyberwar will not be televised; it will use the quantum internet. Because most are too exhausted, neurodivergent or deskilled to participate directly, it will be powered from biometrics inferred from public datasets as people sleep and dream. There will be quantum proxies of individuals generated with polymath grade ethics and ethical hacking capacities, aware of, desiring of and capable of doing what actually has to be done today. People will see images of their doubles randomly across the planet's internet in 2024, saving the planet, using skills and ethics they have in their dreams, imaginations and fictions, but not yet in their waking lives."

## 3 rules of class cyberwar by Captain Amasia

#### 1. Everything functional will be automated.

#### 2. Media will be kid-friendly, playful, pop-speculative art.

#### 3. Regional regulation of housing, education and health targeting individuals of the upper middle class operating the 1%'s corporations will be done via regional press outlets.






# What is the primary mode of participation with 89% mild-heavy neurodivergent societies? Interpassive quantum proxy participation, aka SUPERPOSITIONAL PARTYYYY!

###### Holy fuck they're on to us. They know Amasia.live, PostworkTv.art and Fox2.live have formed a Superpositional Party Postworking Class news syndicate, that simply mocks all the tones of the Extremist Right, Extremist Left and Extremist Undefined and re-orients it accurately towards cyber class war against core fascist upper middle class individuals operating organizations of the 1%  FUCK IT, HIT ALL THE FUCKING BUTTONS! üéÆ

# The primary protocol of cyber class war: interpassive quantum proxy impact-based modelling.

# 21st Century Organizing: Impact-based economics, impact-based governmental organizations, impact-based culture.

Like Dr. Hao, a living alien angel psychedelic mushroom who time traveled back from the Ethical Future year of 2087 to keep these 20th Century Humanities from going full on Virginia Woolf / Walter Benjamin and committing suicide via idiocy and drugs."
