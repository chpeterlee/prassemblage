###### 1. An estimated 11% or less of art curators and theorists are not afflicted by mild-heavy neurodivergence and can make relevant impacts and progress the field in the 21st Century.
###### 2. The other 89% of the field should be sent to graduate programs, social services and therapy." Catpatia Piper, 2024








11% baseline psyche, orgs and thought.







#### "Postworkverse Open Call for any other top 11% skilled 21st Century artist to quit the absolutely boring clusterf--k of Contemporary Art and play batsh-t insane cosplay games with kids, elderly & the mentally ill" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024






## "The Superpositional Party Postwork Awareness campaign powered by stoners / slackers / nerds:

###### Fox2.live: Common sense postwork news for Left and Right in a **RIGHT** tone.

###### Amasia.live: Common sense postwork news for Left and Right in a **LEFT** tone.

###### PostworkTV.art: Common sense postwork news for Left and Right in a POSTWORKING CLASS tone." Catpatia Piper, 2024

### Postworkverse Banana Revolution Manifesto: 

###### 1. Drugs: Shrooms, weed and coffee because cocaine, ketamine and alcohol suck.

###### 2. Media: XR and VR because 89% of society has the literacy of a 13 year old.

###### 3. To keep people distracted from the escape room known as their mild-to-heavy mentally ill mind, postwork scavenger hunt games themed after the Divine Comedy will be built.

I never thought I'd say this, but I actually miss the angry Humanities people screaming nonsense at random shit. 

Reality TV absolutely pales in comparison to batsh-t insane Humanities people.








#### High Intensity Humanities = 
#### the Best Humanities




##### "Due to the limits of popular literacy being capped at 13 years old, the most effective image would simply be to spectacularly punish individual members of the middle class who are committing objectively minor offenses, subjectively major assaults.

##### Wait, this is what the field of art is; petty bourgeouise inarticulation, shitty 13 year old upper middle class pissing on defenseless 13 year old lower middle class." Captain Amasia, 2024
