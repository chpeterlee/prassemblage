##### "POSTWORKVERSE - Neurodivergence & Function-impaired Mental Health Conditions Escape Room Game POV: 
1.  Actually, close to 70% of society has some form of contextual function-impairing mental condition or neurodivergence.
2. This means function-impaired mental health is the NORM and MAJORITY, rather than the minority.
3. In a society where the majority is function-impaired and the non-function impaired minority is too underresourced to regulate the 1%, what options are we left with other than postwork?
4. Try to re-orient your neurodivergent behaviors and function-impaired mental health conditions to create positive impact & better options for yourself and others.

The mentally ill need proper care and facilities. 




###### Dr. Hao's Recommendation for 21st Century Art: Support neurodivergent communities & therapeutic uses of art and co-evolutionary play, but distinguish it from the skilled generalism which is the stupidly boring heart of art. 

###### If you kill the skilled heart of art, all that's left is neurodivergent people floating in space, randomly traumatizing themselves and each other. With the expectations of art production, there's a much higher chance that they will f--k each other up, get sick and murder each other or commit suicide.
1. The entire strength of the human is its capacity to function in a generalized state; at full potential, the human is like a stem cell that can skillfuly specialize at will. However, most humans are in generalized states that cannot skillfully specialize. The most apt term is 'neurodivergent'. 
2. **The neurodivergent are underserved and traumatized in the field of art,** which has expectations of skilled generalism, not unskilled generalism.
3. There are some art praxes created by neurodivergent communities in the past which should simply be redefined as neurodivergent ways of life. **Neurodivergent ways of life should be diversified and complexified, and this is best done in an environment and support structure designed for it - which is not art.**

If 8 out of 10 artists and art worlders are simply neurodivergent individuals who need social services, **there must be at least ~11% of the existing art world that is neither neurodivergent nor conceptually illiterate.**

# " üêà Catpatia Piper's Place Your Bets No. 368:

###### 1. 8/10 artists and art worlders today have some form of neurodivergence.

###### 2. It is more important for them to be receiving proper care by professionally staffed organizations, varying based on intensity of neurodivergence.

###### 3. If they engage in art, it should be functioning primarily as open-ended play and autodidacticism, not as discourse and knowledge production. The best paradigm is John Cage's 'Play Without Purpose' conceptual art praxes.

###### 4. In terms of political solidarity, the neurodivergent, which also form a statistical majority in society, can be engaged with on the basis of Postwork politics. With the public health crisis of mass neurodivergence, there is no possibility of a rapid mass transition to complex logic-based computational technologies and economies. Only fully automated social safety nets, transregional regulation and trans-organizational infrastructure, paid out by the 1%, can possibly function at this time.

###### 5. The Postworkverse media art project and platform is one of the only inclusive and scalable spaces that accounts for all of the above."
