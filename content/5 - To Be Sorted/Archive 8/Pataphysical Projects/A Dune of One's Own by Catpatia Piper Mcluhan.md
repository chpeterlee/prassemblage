![🐈](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tf3/2/16/1f408.png) Excerpt from Dr. Catpatia Piper Mcluhan's 5th Generation Anti-Cat-Pitalist treatise, "A Dune of One's Own" :

Why is only the top 11% of any field driving its paradigm shifts, and the other 89% not?

Because we have a massive epidemic of Dysrationalia, a form of neurodivergence and mental illness, caused by neoliberal capitalism, part of a 500 year old drunk driving hit-and-run by the 1% upon 7 generations of the world's children.

How could we have fields full of individuals producing incredibly evolutionary complex and high positive impact paradigm shifts if 89% of them are suffering from mental illnesses?

It's outrageous to not address this crisis and mass violation of Human Rights of the mentally ill. 

If our society had taken better care of our children and understood their mental illnesses, paid them insurance payments from the 1%'s drunk driver pockets, BEFORE they entered various fields - we would not be in this absolutely terrible position where only 11% of the individuals are capable of actually functioning within them. 

This is an absolute outrage. We need postwork, NOW.
