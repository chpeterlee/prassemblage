Addicted Hungry 🐈 Cat/Dog 🐕  Ghostlinearities  of the 20th Century and 19th Century, doomed to wander the Earth, hopelessly out of time, too deskilled, traumatized and unethical to live in the 21st Century, bemoaning their fate constantly and inaccurately in dangerously obsolete paradigms, blindly cannibalizing each other and everything else, having really bad sex with each other, constantly sick, **never learning, always yearning.** 

They are in constant pain because their eyes are always turned backwards to the past, and their mouth is an anus on the front of their face, blindly pooping out 90% entropy that deforms the mental maps of children, their tentacles clinging to anything within line of sight.




# Is anyone surprised that Walter Benjamin OD'd on morphine and died in extreme pain? The dude was basically the iPhone 1 of theory.


##### Just like there's a 89% failure rate in small business, there is also a 89% failure rate in midsize organizations and also a 89% failure rate amongst researchers and artists. 
##### Why invest in failures when you can invest in the part of the field that actually does its job? Do you want a 17 year old hospital intern who can barely open a bag of chips operating on you or a world-class doctor with a proven track record?
