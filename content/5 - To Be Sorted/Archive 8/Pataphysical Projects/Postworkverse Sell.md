##### Why join the Postworkverse Movement? 
1. It's the **least fucking boring AND LEAST STUPID** of social movements.
2. You get to be weird as fuck and dress up as animals, myths, intellectuals and fiction simultaneously and rant/party.
3. Healthy drugs are encouraged, shitty drugs are banned, people have to self identify their psychosocial diffabilities at the door so you don't end up with insane relationships with insane people, unless you want to üòâ.

#### Enter into the Postworkverse, via the Amasian Biennale, and train in sacred sites across the planet to get in touch with your Antifragile Soul, and grow your spiritual magitek powers through performing and media arts, and engage in Model Kombat with the Trivium and Quadrivium of the Entropos, the alien demon virus causing the massive neurodivergence epidemic today.







#### We all know Peter is an asshole. 

#### But the REAL question is - how much of his soul is still pure with negentropy?

#### Is there REALLY enough pure negentropy in it to bet the devil his soul or is it too corrupted by the alien viral demons of Entropos?

















###### Clearly, today's incapacities in the Humanities proves that exposing the neurodivergent to more complex systems of abstractions requiring more accurate interpretation simply results in worse mental health for them. 

###### They should be receiving professional aid, support and care, not engaging with complex knowledge and discourse production. 

###### Perhaps Foucault wouldn't have sexually predated on children if he wasn't enabled by the knowledge and discourse community and was simply just accurately diagnosed and cared for.











##### Empyreality Game Challenge: if it is difficult to see and describe the objective beauty of reality, then form balanced groups to do so!







### Quality intellectualism and teaching are 2 different skills; I leave the latter to those who enjoy it, for whatever reason! 

### Not my cup of tea, personally. I'm off to the unimaginable land of skilled, ethical and playful elves.

### The cool school is yours!








##### Look guys; most of the world is too neurodivergent for actually complex thought. 

##### Also if you leave them alone, they'll just start abusing each other and doing drugs that suck. 

##### Clearly, the only solution is to dress up like a wizard, back from the ethical future, and run a massive Scavenger Hunt game that spans dreams, aka, the Game of Dreams set in the 0th World, searching for the lost 0th Wonder, using Empyreality technologies.








## "New permanent conceptual performance: if someone is not a polymath, I will only talk with them about fiction that doesn't suck" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

## Upcoming: The Game of Dreams Scavenger Hunt for the 0th Wonder of the 0th World in the Postworkverse, Using the Latest of Empyreality Technologies.

##### Make a character; get your team together; build your Empyreality Headset out of art; quit coke, ketamine and smoking.

###  Connect the neurodivergent, escape to make good art and talk about with only a very few people.








###### If we had a resistance made of polymaths and ethical hackers, all the world's problems would be solved yesterday. Clearly, we don't. What do we have and whats the best shot at organizing it?

1. 72% Heavy neurodivergent who can't think beyond the line-of-sight. They can be powerful in mass quantities, using their blindness. **Imagine 5 year old children. Give them a target.**
2. 17% mild neurodivergent who can't self-organize and self-coordinate across specializations. They can be powerful in mediation and voicing self-awareness of limitations. **Imagine 13 year old adolescents. Team them up.**
3. 11% non-neurodivergent who don't have visibility, resources and access; however we can simply just automate the forces we need, including coordinating the mild and heavy neurodivergent. **Imagine overworked parents. Give them space.**

#### "Inaccurate Mental Maps Are Symptoms of Mild Neurodivergence; Most Political Discourse of Older, Inaccurate and Extreme Left & Right Mental Maps are Simply Symptoms of Mild-Medium Neurodivergence" Dr. Hao, Back From the Ethical Future, 2024

Odds are, if you or someone you know is using older, inaccurate and extremist mental maps, it is symptomatic of neurodivergence! Get checked!

**Mental Health**: 
- Behavioral change, for ecology, society, art and technology.
- Random people addressing the topic in differing ways.
- Extremist political attitudes more of neurodivergence.
- Evolutionary favors blind insanity; we are designed for stuoidity.

1. The understanding of the Human is in such a shitty state that people can't even agree they are in the same species.
2. If humans could define a baseline state of balance, they could pretty accurately say what is good or bad for individuals or groups, then organize them.
3. **1 kid dies every 5 seconds of preventable poverty because of inability to define, measure and act against a baseline humanity: that's about a 82% Holocaust worth of deaths per year.**

# Upcoming for the Amasian Biennale:

1. 89% of today's political conflicts are simply just symptoms of heavy to mild mental illnesses. There are massive human rights violations ongoing of this population.
2. Conceptual performance and mixed media art can be used as a safe simulation space for transregional conflict resolution and postwork transitions between both the mentally ill and non-mentally ill.
3. The proper register of communication is 5 year olds, 13 year olds and mildly mentally ill.

#### "The power of good conceptual art is its compressed metacognitive clarity, evolutionary complexity and cosmophysical novelty. 

##### Clearly, not really something to present to 89% of society who do not have basic metacognition and are simply mild-heavily mentally ill. This population needs a playful, psychedelic and speculative pop sandbox."

Chongha Peter Lee, 2024





Every human is supposed to be maximizing the time spent in a mental state of accurate, fluid and open-ended reason. All the cultural processes exist to do this as does the technology.

However, the purpose of a human mental state cannot easily be specifically pre-stated, other than to best align over time and probabilities with what will produce a negentropic trajectory for the planet and universe's evolution and to minimize existing entropic processes.

Thus, it is not necessary for a human to engage in a particular socio-economic productive or corrective function extending beyond that which is energetically necessary. 

That clearly delineates what is a functional baseline for a state of human mental health as an individual and in relation to a greater social context. Those deviating from this functional baseline to entropic effect thus can simply be deemed as mentally ill.
