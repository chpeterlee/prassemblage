# 0. AUTHORSHIP

While the Poised Realm stars Peter as the protagonist, **it is AUTHORED by 🐇 Captain Amasia**, a modality of a multi-modal-model called State Space, tuned for modelling ethical futures, which in turn, is authored by Peter.



# # 1. ARC
    
The Poised Realm is a 2024 revamping of Dante's Divine Comedy, journeying through 3 realms: 

a. Hell (Pre-20th Century Paradigms)

b. Purgatory (20th Century Paradigms) - Comprised of light/dark/grey refractions of the Trivium & Quadrivium in balance across traditions. 

c. Paradise aka The Empyreal (21st Century Paradigms) (edited)
    
# 2. SETTING
    
To span audiences, it connects 3 dimensions at all times: 
a. Western/Eastern/Non-human references
b. Fantasy/Modernism/Sci-fi
c. Myth/Academic/Anti-art Pop Trash (edited)
    
# 3. THE PROTAGONIST:
    
a. **The protagonist is Peter, but he is functionally dead because he is surrounded by 72% Heavy Neurodivergent individuals and 17% Medium-Mild Neurodivergent individuals.**

b. **To progress through the metaphorical after life and reach the 11% of the population that is not neurodivergent**, he must remember all his lives in the context of the history and future of the universe, and sort it according to Pre-20th/20th Century/21st Century Paradigms.

c. He is also writing it in the form of a Superpositional Gallery show - in which each 'panel' is comprised of traditional media, new media, XR ; Simultaneously he must take a road trip back in time, all the way to the Big Bang to find the Center of the Universe.


# 4. FUNDING
*For 17% middle class specialists who don't have the skill to navigate art autonomously, but need to fulfill some type of psychological, social recognition or professional CV need for whatever reason, there are 3 options to participate.*
1. Pay-to-Play Collaborative Exhibition Credit (prices forthcoming)
2. Pay-to-Play Collaborative Art Residency Credit (prices forthcoming)
3. Pay-to-Play Collaborative Publishing Credit (prices forthcoming)
These costs should be paid out by specialist organizations as either high tier consulting or by public organizations as mental health, occupational therapy and social work services.

# 5. Political Party Endorsed: The Price is Wrong Gameshow Party, aka the Superpositional Party of the Postworking Class

# 6. Form:
- Hell-scrolling
- Purgatory-scrolling
- Paradise-scrolling
# 7. 3 peters:

- Ethical future dead Peter sold his soul to the devil. Super successful in life, but now in Hell and it fucking sucks. Being punished by the EFI and send back in time, reverse, to kill himself.
- Peter in the present doing the unlikely
- Greywalker Peter in hyperbolic chamber of Purgatory of the Adjacent possible.

8. TAINTLYTICS

- agricultural workers/ stoners= Kung fu and riddles 
- Asian/immigrant nerd gamers/consumers = engineers and mafia
- crazy white people = appreciate beauty and not working.

# "Accuracy Encryption Protocol" 2024

Anything accurate is already encrypted for most of the population.







### Academics and Artists all have the same 2 problems:

1. Accurate modelling
2. Positive impact

Most likely, 89% of both are not going to solve these problems. Why expect it of them? 

The best use of these people's time is partying and piecemeal transregional regulation and balancing, that's all.

## 🐈 Dr. Catpatia Piper Mcluhan
##### Both Sciences and Arts are 60+ years from actually solving any problems... and are basically super mediocre....

That means the only thing worth doing is just building things that work immediately, going to press, and partying!

**Skip the academics and careerists, they are both f-cked!******







In the movie, **"The Artist: Model Kombat"**, Peter stops talking to specialists and simply just builds solutions and goes to press. 

Then parties with weirdo specialists, because they are great at it!

Solutions -> Press 
Peter -> Party With Weirdos!
