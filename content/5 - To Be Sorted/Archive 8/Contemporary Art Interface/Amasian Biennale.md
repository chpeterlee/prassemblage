1. Self-driven protocol
2. Dysrationalia accessible - lower tier.
3. Blacklist / scoring / transplant work

##### Ethics in light of the mass neurodivergence epidemic of 2024:
 1. If we know that most of the 17% neurodivergent specialists have Dysrationalia, a form of neurodivergence, then all that's morally obligated is to offer them a better option. 
 2. When they don't take it, then only the fact that the better option was offered needs reiterating, along with a link to resources to neurodivergence therapy and services.
3. Thus, we can also take a more accurate portrait of how much of the population suffers from Dysrationalia, based on better options accurately offered and rejected.

### 3 outcomes of attempts at transdisciplinary intellectualism in the U.S.:

###### Outcome 1, 72% of the time: extremely narrow specialist + extremely narrow specialist = a science and art reference side by side.

###### Outcome 2, 17% of the time: less narrow specialist + less narrow specialist = a complex mess which 2 people on Earth can understand.

###### Outcome 3, 11% of the time: a new paradigm shift, which intertwines complex trajectories of multiple fields in such a way that everyone can come to agreement on new fundamental principles.






##### "Photographic portraits of neurodivergent individuals with Dysrationalia NOT taking better options, or taking close to a year to realize what the statistically verifiable better option actually was. The offerer having fulfilled their moral obligation of doing so, and thus free of any further commitment, while simultaneously accurately registering the neurodivergent individual's degree of Dysrationalia." Amasian Biennale, 2024


















# Wtf is 2024 actually?
1. Clearly, 89% of the planet has Dysrationalia because they're not going to teach themselves the skills they could Google any day to basically build, hack or learn anything.
2. The only minimum ethical obligation required is to correctly diagnose individuals with Dysrationalia, so they know what illness to Google, and then move on.
3. **Thus, if one has world class skills, then it's simply just a matter of making a shortlist of others who do also, and then working only with them.**






## Next:

1. Make a ton of money, destroy dumb upper middle class.
2. Stop making art with non-artists, only make parties, games and jokes snd toys with them.
3. Go solo in art.
