1. Conceptual & Systems Architecture by Chongha Peter Lee. A Great Amasian Novel, Amasian Renaissance Theater Play & Complexity Science Fiction.
2. Secondary one-off contributions and quotes from whomever. But they will be filtered by most accurate to least accurate.
3. Also, there will be a running greylist of all the entropic and inaccurate thinkers, discourses and practices producing entropic information and behaviors relating to ecology and society in the 21st Century.
4. Why? Because we don't want mentally ill, inaccurate and mediocre adults unnecessarily traumatizing children to be as mentally ill, inaccurate and mediocre.
5. That being said, both mentally ill, inaccurate and mediocre adults and children are welcome to try and teach themselves whatever skills necessary to contribute to a novel that will save the planet! Or not, of course, up to them.




### Epiphany




##### üêà Dr. Catpatia Piper Mcluhan:
###### "89%+ of the field of art is not equipped for producing paradigm shifts in the field, let alone across fields; hence why expect them? 

###### Of this 89%, 17% simply need a peer environment for doing what they are specialized in for each other, 72% need therapy.

###### Trying to put them in the paradigm shifting transdisciplinary arena would be like asking a 13 year old to pilot a space ship to Mars; objectively possible, HIGHLY unlikely." Dr. Catpatia Piper Mcluhan, 2024
