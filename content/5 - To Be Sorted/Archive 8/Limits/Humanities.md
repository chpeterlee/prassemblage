2. Super inclusive
3. Nice weirdos - reframing of Public culture

### Clearly, we've reached a point where academic art is just as, if not more, dead than commercial art. 

### In those regards, I gift you with an artwork:








## "May Your Side of the Titanic Sink Slower" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024














e 3 things the Humanities need to do:

1. Realize it's going to take 60 years for most of it to reach the 21st Century
2. Get money
3. Get weird and party

## A Life Unimagined
###### While I am a firm advocate for a solid functional foundation of both Arts and Sciences skills, there is absolutely no point in living if not to engage in the human species' highest potentiality ‚Äî using imagination to produce unimaginable phenomena.  

**Everyone does not need to use their imagination to save the world, but they need to use their imagination day in and day out to save themselves, those around them and their regions.**

**Personally, I prefer to work with those who are at the degree of world-scale impact for world-scale projects, but I cannot help myself from assisting in the pilgrimage of those who are drawn to the path of the unimaginable.**














##### üê¢ Dr. Manny Turtle Hardgorp Has Devised a Transregional Turtle Shell Strategy For 89% of the Non-sciences Fields:

1. **ZERO CONSTRAINTS ART**: Sandbox, themeless, subculture friendly curatorial framework 
2. **ZERO BORING SOCIALIZING**: Psychedelic, Cosplay Party Games
3. **ZERO SKILL ACTIVISM**: Interpassively contribute piecemeal to most accurately defined regional balancing, Dysrationalia awareness and verifiably positive impact culture and art

#### "Performance Artwork: Due to Public Mental Health Concerns, Humanities Individuals Advised to Seek Occupational Therapy & Art Therapy, Rather Than Engage in Art as a Professional Field of Discourse, Modelling and Impact" Amasian Biennale, 2024


Delegated Performance Art / Interpassive Media Art: interpassive proxy and delegated transregional activism and deferral to most accurately defined regional balances. 

7 year olds welcome to try; every 7 seconds is potential. Peter personally does not put eggs in that basket, up to others. Believes it's highly unlikely. Hope he's wrong!











Interpassive Proxy Deference

## Impact-based Art (a 21st Century Paradigm) :
1. Impact-based Art is art defined and valued by a baseline of positive planetary evolutionary impacts. There can be smaller scale impacts defined at will, all the way down to a single photon and parsec.
2. Because most of the Humanities and Sciences are heavily afflicted by Dysrationalia, and are incapable of sustainable, inclusive, scalable discourse, producing accurate models and implementing diverse methods rapidly (most academies being approximately 60 years away from this level of function), part of the art of Impact-based Art is defining, modelling and verifying the impacts.
3. Innovating in Impact-based Art is generally not advised for 89% of fields utilizing 20th Century paradigms and skills to engage within. Rather, for 89% it is offered as a tool to simply reframe existing practices, if desired. 
4. Although, of course, it's possible a 7 year old could teach themselves to make positive planetary-scale or smaller scale evolutionary impacts, Impact-based Art makes an assumption that it's highly unlikely, encourages them to learn and try safely in fun game environments like Model Kombat, but fingers crossed.ü§û 
5. Impact-based Art ALWAYS advocates for engaging in safe modelling sandboxes prior to attempting to impact real world systems.

# PLAN:
1. Peter moves forward with world saving art, to make the cultural equivalents of the parents happy, and also so his actual mom and brother officially allow him back into the family, **of humans.**
2. Because art moves at the speed of molasses, **he organizes Model Kombat parties with younger and cooler zillenial people, everywhere and anywhere.**
3. His true Masterpiece which will be unrecognized until all the zillenials are older and have occupied institutional positions, **and will only be grasped by children today**, will be a sprawling, high octane, absurd and insane video game and LARP.
