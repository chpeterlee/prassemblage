# The easiest way to split the American art world:

## 1. Art Therapy Art World
All art dealing with individual mental illness, trauma and low literacy in relation to adequate opportunity to self-teach. 
## 2. Non-Art Therapy Art World
All art not dealing with the above BUT ALSO INCLUDING intellectualism and infrastructure to support the mentally ill, traumatized and those with low literacy.

###### "Action Potentialism: An art movement based on the term from neuroscience describing the N^-1 power combinatorials for neurons and nerves — and matter — at rest, to transform electric & chemical potential energy, and the darkweb-first movement minimalizing physical actualization, maximizing open-ended opportunities and self-organizing via asynchronous, emergent antinomies" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Also, the purpose of culture is not to heal, function, or teach - it is simply to re-inforce action potential! Art is just inventing stuff and getting paid for it.

### Ethics of Action Potentialism: Peter just says its objective fact that they could do anything, thats it. Then the AI goes and fixes the world, based on a cast of peoples' potentialities, actuated by media and simulators.
