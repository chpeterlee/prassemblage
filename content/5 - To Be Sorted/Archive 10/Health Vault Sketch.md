1. Body organs - Most fundamental to least
	1. **Brain:** The brain is the body's control center, responsible for coordinating all physiological and cognitive functions. It regulates essential processes such as consciousness, cognition, movement, sensory perception, and homeostasis.
	2. **Heart:** The heart pumps oxygenated blood to all tissues and organs, delivering nutrients and oxygen while removing waste products. It is essential for maintaining circulation and sustaining life.
	3. **Lungs:** The lungs facilitate gas exchange, allowing oxygen from the air to enter the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to be removed from the body. They are crucial for respiration and oxygenation of tissues.
	4. **Liver:** The liver performs numerous vital functions, including metabolism of nutrients, detoxification of harmful substances, synthesis of proteins, storage of glycogen, and production of bile for digestion.
	5. **Kidneys:** The kidneys filter waste products and excess substances from the blood to produce urine, maintaining electrolyte balance, blood pressure, and fluid volume. They also play a role in regulating acid-base balance and hormone production.
	6. **Pancreas:** The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes and hormones such as insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels. It is crucial for digestion and glucose metabolism.
	7. **Small Intestine:** The small intestine is responsible for digestion and absorption of nutrients from food, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals.
	8. **Large Intestine (Colon):** The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes from undigested food, forming feces for elimination. It also houses a large population of beneficial gut bacteria that contribute to digestion and immune function.
	9. **Skin:** While not an organ in the traditional sense, the skin is the body's largest organ and serves as a protective barrier against pathogens, dehydration, and environmental insults. It also regulates body temperature and facilitates sensory perception.
2. Bio-Chemical - Most Fundamental to Least
	1. Core molecules: Blood + Oxygen + Glucose + Water + ADP
	2. Structuring & Modulators: Lipids + Enzymes
	3. Signalling: DNA + Protein + Hormones + Neurotransmitters
3. Bio-electric Networks & Neurofeedback Patterns
	1. Architecture: Nerve Networks, Nerves, Neuron cells, Axons & Dendrites, Microtubules
	2. Basic Message Units: Excitors & Inhibitors, Neurotransmitters, Dopamine, Serotonin and etc.
	3. Feedback systems : Gut-brain axis, Thalamic Loops, Cholinergic, Dopaminergic, Serotonergic

Brain Function Subsystems:
- 1. **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**:
    - Responsible for maintaining unconscious organ functions.
    - It controls involuntary processes such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing.
    - The ANS has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (which activates the “fight or flight” response) and the parasympathetic nervous system (which promotes relaxation and rest).
    - Examples of ANS-controlled functions include heartbeat regulation, pupil dilation, and digestion.
2. **Limbic System**:
    - Modulates subconscious functions in response to stimuli.
    - Key structures within the limbic system include the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus.
    - The hippocampus is involved in memory formation and spatial navigation.
    - The amygdala plays a role in emotional processing and fear responses.
    - The hypothalamus regulates hunger, thirst, body temperature, and the endocrine system.
3. **Cerebral Cortex**:
    - Responsible for conscious functions and simulation of action plans.
    - The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the brain and is highly developed in humans.
    - It is divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital.
    - Functions include sensory perception, motor control, language processing, and higher-order thinking.
    - The prefrontal cortex, part of the frontal lobe, is involved in decision-making, planning, and personality.
