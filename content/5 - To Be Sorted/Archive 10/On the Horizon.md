# Prediction: Entering an era of Post-Misdiagnosis
###### Mentally ill, traumatized and undereducated individuals will simply be diagnosed and directed to adequate drugs, care and education, ***not encouraged to participate in complex, high-stakes discourses and speculative arenas without adequate safe guards and skills.***

### SMOKE WEED, PAY NO HEED! GOOD STONERS = BANANA REVOLUTIONARIES!




# The Postworkverse: We Could Save the World Paradox
1. 89%+ of the world's population shouldn't be doing more than waking up, eating and smoking weed.
2. A postwork society would effectively care for such a population doing nothing, and would go to further and further lengths to keep them alive and work less and less.
3. This population's intentional/unintentional entropy is the main barrier to producing the infrastructure necessary for a postwork society to keep them alive.




# The Right-to-Claim-Biochemically-Proofed-Accurate-Diagnostics:
1. If someone is drunk or totally tripping balls, we strip them of their right to act and speak and claim.
2. Based on statements and biochemical tests, **we can infer if an individual has the Right-to-Claim-Biochemical-Sanity, per claim. We can also just automate this.**
3. Hence, why even bother arguing or stressing biochemically insane individuals? It's worse for their health, just get them better drugs and send them to a proper program.











###### "Performance of Peter Going Before Civilian Courts of Various Origins To Be Tried and Exiled for the Artistic Crime of Being Horrible At Being an Art World Stoner, Slacker and Specialist ‚Äî

‚Äî Thus Absolutely Unfit For **89%** of the Art World Which is Made of Stoners, Slackers and Specialists Who Need Drugs, Therapy and Education.

Perhaps Peter May Be Reformed Through A Life Sentence Condemning Him to Only Work With 11% or Less of the Art World Who Are Polymaths" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024




###### "Participatory Performance: Fire Peter, exile him or burn his effigy for being absolutely unfit to work with the 89% of the art world which is stoners, slackers and specialists.

###### Condemn him to Hell, the insane asylum and exoplanetary atmospheres which comprise the 11% of the art world that has skilled, ethical and imaginative polymaths, to produce postwork infrastructure for the 89%." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024







# "Don't Die Stupidly and/or Live Lovelessly: The Ultimate Avant Garde Hyperobject Sculpture" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024







## "Conceptual Performance Art: Individuals with low capacity for reason concerning any real world system, somehow not dead yet" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Some individuals simply living another day defies all odds due to the utter dysfunction of their physical movements and mental models; they are my artistic material.








### "Mass performance of people having zero real-world multi-causal systems logics, aka skills, and somehow not dying" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Somehow, people run around without knowing how any real world systems work, and they don't die. That's performance art.








# The easiest way to split the American art world:

## 1. Art Therapy Art World
All art dealing with individual mental illness, trauma and low literacy in relation to adequate opportunity to self-teach. 
## 2. Non-Art Therapy Art World
All art not dealing with the above BUT ALSO INCLUDING intellectualism and infrastructure to support the mentally ill, traumatized and those with low literacy.







##### "Ongoing Participatory Performance Open Call: The Less Literate, Deskilled and Mentally Ill Biochemically Driven to Destroy Themselves and Each Other in the Wake of Systemic Trauma and Infrastructural Incompetence Caused by the 1%" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Peoples' daily entropy is the performance artwork, for better or worse, mostly the latter.

###### "Action Potentialism: An art movement based on the term from neuroscience describing the N^-1 power combinatorials for neurons and nerves ‚Äî and matter ‚Äî at rest, to transform electric & chemical potential energy, and the darkweb-first movement minimalizing physical actualization, maximizing open-ended opportunities and self-organizing via asynchronous, emergent antinomies" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Also, the purpose of culture is not to heal, function, or teach - it is simply to re-inforce action potential! Art is just inventing stuff and getting paid for it.


### Ethics of Action Potentialism: Peter just says its objective fact that they could do anything, thats it. Then the AI goes and fixes the world, based on a cast of peoples' potentialities, actuated by media and simulators.

#### Postworkverse: We Could Save the World - an Action Potentialist Musical

## If you can't do, don't act, you will do more harm than good! Joy without reason and play without purpose! Health is wealth! use all the energy saved.







###### "Performance: Peter Takes the Vow of Least Stupidity for his Induction into the Church of Just Pricing, A Jainist Variant Which Emphasizes Postwork Inaction Over Stupid People Acting Stupidly, Endangering Themselves and Others. Thus, Asking Him to Help Stupid People With Stupid Things is Religious Oppression By a Fascist Individual. His Faith Only Allows Him to Refuse to Help Stupid People With Stupid Things; However Helping Stupid People do Smart Things is Not Excluded, and the Labor Will be Priced Justly." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024
























###### "The Prophesy of the Church of Just Pricing: deskilling, inaccuracy and a culture of poor health produce the near-autistic fascists on the Right and the fascist anti-fascists on the Left ‚Äî both simply variations of the same errors of mono-causality, anti-intellectualism and neurochemical imbalance.

#### THOU SHALT RECEIVETH WEED GUMMIES." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024








# Making Therapy Art  vs. Making Non-Therapy Art:

###### 1. Guys, if someone is impaired, they need professional care, not education, and DEFINITELY not debate. Redirect them to medical care. AT MOST give them proper drugs, a good youtube/podcast playlist and some random art aasignments. Don't overcomplicate it, you will endanger their health. Expect nothing, let them enjoy themselves.

###### 2. If someone is not impaired, they can withstand questions and engage in evidence-based debates. 

#### There is no need to make things more accessible for unimpaired individuals; if you reduce complex discourses for impaired individuals they will misinterpret it and endanger their health. Just cut to the chase and send them to the hospital.















#### "In art, put the impaired individuals in therapy, separate from the unimpaired ‚Äî just as special needs are cared for separately from those without. Not doing so endangers the health of the impaired." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024




##### "Bet on a belief by the Church of Just Pricing: in 2024, intaking impaired individuals into art rather than redirecting them to proper care is going to damage their health and incur lawsuits on the organizations intaking them.

##### Who's fault is this, and should thus foot the bill to hire the unimpaired to invent, build and implement solutions? The 1%, of course." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024




##### "The 2nd-World-Cene: Literally, the dissemination of the concept of the Anthropocene can be used like a biomarker for the 2nd World, tracing all the deskilling, systemic trauma and mental illness of the 2nd World (Including 89% of 1st World Regions). Whoever got suckered into it, now we can diagnose them adequately as having one or all 3 of classic 2nd World ailments, caused by the 1% who obviously should pay out for the damage." The G.O.A.T. üêê, 2024

## "The Polymaths: A Hyperobject Sculpture" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024
An action potentialist film centered around polymaths who have the skills to save the planet now.  Instead of being defined as individual geniuses by social or divine recognition, they are defined as participatory hyperobject sculptures who are fed and supported by the contributions of all other individuals, human and non-human, living and dead ‚Äî similar to children.

Anyone contributing will be accurately credited, compensated and granted a share to whatever degree appropriate as most accurately valued at the time.










**(a Film 100% Not Designed for Non-Polymaths)

**Chongha Peter Lee, 2024**

**Basically a film for the least stupid people on Earth ‚Äî polymath ethical hackers ‚Äî there's probably 100 alive.**

For everyone else, there's plenty of backlog material + drugs!

















#### "2nd-World-Cene Prophesy by the G.O.A.T.: 

###### Artists who need therapy will end up in the hospital ‚Äî due to deskilling, inaccuracy and poor health ‚Äî either before they are irreversibly sick or after they are irreversibly sick; non-therapy artists simply steadily produce just pricing and infrastructure" The G.O.A.T. üêê, 2024

Look; if you don't learn to do, think and live, you're going to end up in the hospital. Better to go BEFORE you get irreversibly sick. **It's not a curse, it's a prophesy.**








##### "An album of love songs composed around a single ongoing, profuse apology, in various popular music forms, for demonstrating polymath intelligence in public, to a public too traumatized, mentally ill and undereducated to consciously comprehend it, but perhaps, in an odd, fleeting moment during a dream or following a hot shower, 2 and 2 comes together like LSD and Gatorade." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024










###### "Bet: If traumatized, mentally ill and/or undereducated, you will be worse off in art than getting therapy, life coaching and an education. 

###### Also, organizations expose themselves to the risk of lawsuits by intaking these individuals and underserving them. In some cases, underserving them is better than leaving them without any support at all.

###### If you hire them as staff, you're constraining the scalability of your organization, which is fine, in so long as it's a conscious decision." The G.O.A.T. üêê, 2024






## Against Ratiocide (The Unjust Murder of Reason and Reason as Unjust Murder Weapon - Also a Sin in the Church of Just Pricing)

An exhibition by the Assemblies of 7.





### It's physically impossible to explain intelligence to the biochemically immature; better to just give them drugs and wait for physical reality to cancel them until they do mature.
