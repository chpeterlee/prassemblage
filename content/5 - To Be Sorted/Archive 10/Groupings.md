###### "Does objectively entropic art suddenly become negentropic if it's in the Venice Biennale, or [x] museum, event or collection? Does objectively negentropic art suddenly become entropic if it's produced and circulated in a non-art world setting? Is someone answering yes to these 2 questions a sign of their absolute lack of coherent thought and probable trauma stemming from a cognitive incapacity, and thus a solid medical basis for advising them to seek cognitive behavioral therapy and provisionally disqualifying their failed attempts at legitimately rational discourse?" Detective Crowlee Playing Han Jerry Larry's Game of Regions, 2024













# "Factual Realism" Han Jerry Larry, 2024

















#### "Perhaps we are post-truth, primarily because nobody actually accurately defined truth, but we 100% will never be post-facts. Also, it's safe to say anybody who bought the bag of bullshit labelled post-truth is probably not someone you would really want to ask about anything more complicated than how to tie shoes."

# "Claims-based Art" The Groupings of 7, 2024





##### "Bet: Markets, like communities, are constrained by the informational capacities of the individuals constituting it. Dumb individuals in art markets = dumb art markets. Communities comprised of systemically traumatized individuals = requires healing and aid.

###### 1. For systemically traumatized communities, you provide aid, services and access, fairly priced and subsidized by public funds and benefactors.

###### 2. For dumb art markets, the only ethical thing to traffic is spectacular pranks, forgeries and humiliation.

###### 3. Bonus points if you can somehow loop them into one system to kill 2 birds with one stone. " The Assemblage of 7, 2024







# Vibetonomists

###### Vibetonomists insist on the right to vibe, even to the detriment of their own health and others, usually from poor mental health.

###### If they are aware of it, it is totally fine to let them self-destruct and die! 

###### If they are impinging upon your health, it is your right to defend yourself proportionally.










### "The Art of the Perfect Riot for the GTAnnale" By Joseph BBoys and the Coyote Intelligence Agency, 2024








##### "1. Majority of Art is Pre-20th Century: Poetry, Theater and Healthy Drugs, Love and Raves!

##### 2. 20th Century Art is Academics + Specialists in a Modelling Economy, Via Fiction, Jokes and Films

##### 3. 21st Century Art is Independent Polymath Ethical Hackers in an Impact Economy" Han Jerry Larry, 2024 







# "Next: The Cool School of Magitech, NOT Art" The Assemblage of 7, 2024

### Guys, it's 2024, who makes art except boring, uncool fools? ***TIME FOR MAGITECH!***









### "What if the only thing we could actually agree upon in art was who to destroy?" Han Jerry Larry, 2024

Accurate! Art can only produce a consensus on who to destroy, it sucks at absolutely everything else.








###### Art as a field is way too deskilled to produce anything; hence the only thing it can do is negate things. We will have to do this without communicating, because even this too is a skill. 

-- Captain Amasia







##### Given a skilled artist, art can be impactful. **Without skills, it's objectively possible for an artist to be impactful, but it is of very low likelihood, ** and the likelihood of impact drops as the diversity of contexts and the degree of complexity increases.

-- Han Jerry Larry




#### "The Skillpocalypse: a "




#### "The Problems Afflicting 50%+ of the Population is Low Literacy and Some Form of Mental Illness; Art is Not the Answer For Them, Play-Based Skills Therapy and Healthy Drugs Are." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Really, they don't need art, they need to playfully acquire skills and take healthy drugs.


Basically, the internet should be split by zones of literacy and differing levels of mental health, then intermediated by AI.

-- Han Jerry Larry

---



Playful Occupational Therapy + Healthy Drugs for 50%+ of the Population; Deconstructionist Art for 17%.







Art for markets of idiots = no thanks

Art for specialists in fields that are decades away from competent transdisciplinary production = agonizing and boring.

Art for the masses, who are 50%+ mentally ill and have a below 6th grade reading level = LET'S GOOO.

-- Han Jerry Larry

----





###### "55% of the U.S. has a below 6th grade reading level; 50%+ have some form of mental illness. 

###### An entirely different approach is needed; primarily playful occupational therapy + healthy drugs - like weed and shrooms.

###### Aka, the P.O.T. + pot strategy." Health is Political Center, 2024








##### "Perhaps We Are Post-Truth, But It is a Near Physically Impossibility to Be Post-Fact." Han Jerry Larry, 2024

Truth was too poorly defined to defend; facts are almost impossible to destroy. 

Forget truth; we start from facts, we can rebuild the ability to compare theories per context and compare values per context.






1. Public culture is 100 years away from adequate systems literacy. 
 - Solution: Playful Occupational Therapy + Pot. No more complex than 3 steps.
2. Institutions/organizations are 60 years away from effective knowledge production and impact.
 - Solution: Incentivized regional exhibitions deconstructing unicausal paradigms + AI to do actual heavy lifting.
3. Most individuals are too specialized/ traumatized to rapidly self teach.
  - Solution: Only work with polymath ethical hackers to solve complex problems; make a fairy tale puzzle game to skim publics.
-- Han Jerry Larry





###### Bet: Most of culture from 2016+ was simply tech making existing tools and paradigms more accessible to previously excluded populations; there is going to be a shifting emphasis going forwards towards balancing actually novel impactful paradigm shifts with the constraints of literally 1 in 2 people being either mentally ill, having a below 6th grade literacy, or both.

Literally, in the U.S. if you are in a room with 1 other person, 1 of you is either mentally ill or has a below 6th grade
literacy.

2. Perception open discussion space for Kids and Josh with media culture and tech. Hang with ozan + sam
3. Concepts: Against Monocausality Exhibition, a Zone Defense of Impactful Art








# "Biomonotony: the exact opposite of biodiversity" Emergent Centers, 2024











### Is the Price Just? A gameshow accurately valuing the most impactful artists and projects in your region and critiquing the most unjust prices, with awesome music!








### "An Event is a Complex, Multi-Causal System; Mono-Causal Interpretations of Events Are Racist, Fascist, and Easily Provable Objective Conceptual Inaccuracies" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Humanities are still way too 









##### "Why 50%+ of your region either reads at below a 6th grade level or has some form of mental illness: Mono-causal ideation" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Best treatment: forget education, assemble the right schedule of healthy drugs and culture.





Splits:

1. The 55% mentally ill and low literacy: Burning man style drugs first art festivals.
2. The 34% middle class specialists: Regional gameshow, critique of unjust prices, class action lawsuits and AI for all heavy lifting.
3. The 11% polymaths: whitepapers, hacking, wagers and painting.

## "A List of Individuals Who Can Still Think and Act Independently; Everyone Else Redirected Towards Those at Their Level", Chongha Peter Lee, 2024







## Self-organize into 3 skill ecologies:

1. **PRACTICE:** Vibe-performers (50%+) (Test and Verify Processes Via Performance)
2. **THEORY:** Administrator-teachers (39%) (Critique Unjust Pricing and Recommend Just Pricing Via Media Games)
3. **IMPACT:** Polymath-ethical hackers (11%) (Simply Hack and Wage Cyber Class War)

**-- Q-Fanon, 5G Cyber Class War Theorist**







"Therapy, Teaching, Administration, Research, Impact are 5 Different Skill-Based Games. 

**Less than 11% of the population can play them all well; most can play 1 or 1.5 decently.**

Self-organization begins there, from current limits." Han Jerry Larry, 2024

# "The Neuronal Event" Han Jerry Larry, 2024

The real Ground Zero! You can't have a thought without sculpting a neuron. Physically impossible.






## "21st Century Art is Art and Neuronal Events Without Monocausality, Dialectics and Triviality" Han Jerry Larry, 2024

This is practically an unimaginable zen riddle for 89%+ of the Humanities. 

Thankfully, we don't people to imagine things - we just need their neurons to be able to be resculpted.






Splits:

1. For the 50%+ mentally ill and low literacy: Nomadic + psychedelic Burning Man culture and raves.
2. For the middle class: Dialectic fortune telling and fairy tale.
3. For the polymaths: GAMESHOW!
----




###### 1. The Pre-20th Century: Objects (Both of Waking Life and Dream) 
- This is 50-60% of the population who will evidence either mental illness or low literacy. The solution is to direct them towards nomadic, tribal, psychedelic culture.
###### 2. The 20th Century: Dialectics (Both of Indexes and Signs)
- This is specialists of fields of both Humanities and Sciences. They can work consistently in repetitive patterns, but they need either polymaths or AI proxies to do the heavy lifting, synthesis and direction.
###### 3. The 21st Century: Impact-Based Valuations (Both of Actual System Events and Potential System Events)
- Independent polymath ethical hackers, playing peace games and cyber class war.
