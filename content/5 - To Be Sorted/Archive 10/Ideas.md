##### "Postworkverse: We Could Save the World Musical Game at Ideapplebees (Aka Fuck Trying and Dying; Get High and Heal)

###### Peter offers an artist or individual with mental illness, trauma or low literacy who needs therapy, not art, $1,000 worth of his high literacy art to not make art, just go to therapy, smoke weed, take a vacation while their AI twin participates in a high literacy art project they can connect with via AI, stream and XR at any time" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024







Postworkverse: We Could Save the World Musical Game 
1. 2/3 of the population should be focusing on getting better at the labor of staying alive another 24 hours, nothing else. They should be getting high and healing, not trying and dying. Everything functional should be left to AI twins.
2. 23% should be just administrating, mediating and implementing new healing paradigms for them with the help of AI.
3. 11% should be imagining, inventing, proofing and modifying new paradigms to resolve the planet's ecosocial issues using anything.

Level 1:
1. Get high and heal ; interface with AI; watch twins save the world while you are high and healing. Vertigo, fairy tale, musical. 
Do Nothing

Level 2:
1. verify, admin, mediate. Defer to AI, and use AI fortunetellers. Have a default Exhibition. Works while you dream.
For sake of L1, Automate

Level 3:
1. imagine, invent, prototype
Come and participate

###### "The blowback of crappy infrastructure, systemic trauma and undereducation: you have mentally ill, traumatized and low literacy individuals working in positions where they are damaging others' lives, infrastructures and ecologies DAILY. 

###### The correct solution? Retire them ASAP, automate their functions, pay out their treatments and welfare via class action lawsuits of institutions and corporations and promote awareness of mass deadly incompetence." Han Jerry Larry, 2024

###### "The Majority of Contemporary Art History (20th Century Culture) is a Succession of Unhealthy Individuals Who Should Be Receiving 21st Century Health Services; it is Not a Succession of Paradigm Shifts, Expanding and Complexifying Capacity for Negentropic Impact in a 21st Century Environment.

**How Likely is it That Something Significant in the 21st Century Will Be Produced By These Unhealthy 20th Century Individuals? It's Possible, But HIGHLY Unlikely, With High Likelihood of Catastrophe as the Outcome. Why Bet on That?**
###### Solution: Send Unhealthy 20th Century Individuals to Get the 21st Century Health Services They Need; Make and Use 21st Century Paradigm Shifts to Support Them & Other Negentropic Impacts." Chongha Peter Lee.
