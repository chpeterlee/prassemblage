#### Trix, AI and drugs are for 2nd World kids; invention is for independent planetary polymaths.
###### 2nd World is for drugs, jokes and raves! Use AI to get and keep a job and maintain health in the 2nd World; forget large or rapid change - leave the intellectualism and invention for a few polymaths.

###### A proper art school leaves people to self-teach and self-organize; proper therapy guarantees positive outcomes for individuals who have mental illness, trauma or low literacy.  

###### If one needs therapy, that should be dealt with first before engaging in art. Seek actual therapy, not art. Long-term, the individual will have better health with real therapy first. If you send them to art, they are more likely to worsen in health.

###### To keep their psyche stimulated, engage them with low cognitive-load psychedelic drugs, jokes and raves.

###### Human behavior can simply be modelled as combinatorials of neurochemical system states - super simple! Throw away the semiotics; so few have enough literacy to discuss across conceptual boundaries productively â€” nobody is actually talking.

###### Most humans are easily explained as giant walking bags of drugs that aren't self aware enough to intentionally trigger and control their high, so they simply subject themselves to or construct arbitrary sh-t to get high.

###### Humans are living bags of drugs; human culture is simply solving the problem of managing highs. 

###### Biochemical drivers also explain why most humans are biased against literacy, complexity and creativity. 

###### Hence, better drugs = more complex humans!
