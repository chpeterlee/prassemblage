Axiom 1. An event is never the concentration of a vital continuity, or the immanent intensification of a becoming. It is never coextensive with becoming. It is, on the contrary, on the side of a pure break with the becoming of an object of the world, through the auto-apparition of this object. Correlatively, it is the supplementation of apparition [l‚Äôappara√Ætre] by the emergence [surgissement] of a trace: what formerly inexisted becomes intense existence.
	1. **An Event Is Not Continuous Growth**: (Timing)
	    - Badiou argues that an event is not merely a gradual development or continuous process. It doesn‚Äôt emerge from a smooth flow of existence.
	    - Instead, an event represents a radical break or rupture with the ordinary flow of things.
	2. **Not Coextensive with Becoming**: (Difference)
	    - An event is distinct from the ongoing process of ‚Äúbecoming.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just an intensified version of what already exists.
	    - It stands apart, disrupting the usual patterns.
	3. **Auto-Apparition and Emergence**: (Hidden to Vision and Disruption)
	    - When an event occurs, something previously hidden or unnoticed suddenly appears (auto-apparition).
	    - This emergence disrupts the status quo and introduces something new.
	4. **Supplementation of Existence**: ()
	    - The event supplements existence by making what was previously nonexistent intensely real.
	    - It adds a trace, leaving a lasting impact.
	In summary, Badiou‚Äôs Axiom 1 emphasizes that events are transformative moments that break away from the ordinary, revealing something previously hidden and altering our understanding of existence. üåüüîç[5].

Axiom 3. The event would not be the inseparable encroachment of the past on the future, or the eternally past being of the future. It is, to the contrary, a vanishing mediator, an intemporal instant which renders disjunct the previous state of an object (the site) and the state that follows. We could equally say that the event extracts from a time the possibility of another time. This other time, whose materiality envelops the consequences of the event, deserves the name of a new present. The event is neither past nor future. It makes us present to the present.
	1. **Not Bound by Time**: The axiom starts by stating that an event isn't merely an extension of the past into the future or solely defined by past occurrences continuing into the future. Essentially, it's not trapped by the timeline of past or future.
	2. **The Role of the Event as a Mediator**: It describes the event as a "vanishing mediator," a fleeting, momentary force that separates what happened before (the previous state) from what comes after (the subsequent state). This means that an event serves as a brief but critical bridge that divides and defines before and after.
	3. **Creating New Possibilities**: The axiom suggests that an event allows for the emergence of new possibilities. It pulls out from a particular time the potential for a new and different time. This is akin to extracting a new opportunity from a given situation.
	4. **Resulting in a New Present**: The consequences and the essence of the event bring about what is termed a "new present." This "new present" envelops the outcomes of the event and is characterized by a new reality or material state that the event has introduced.
	5. **Focus on the Present**: Finally, the axiom concludes by emphasizing that the event is neither about the past nor the future. Instead, it focuses on making us aware of and grounded in the present moment.

Axiom 4. The event would not be the result of the actions and passions of a body, nor does it differ in nature from them. To the contrary, an active and adequate body in a new present is an effect of the event, as we have seen in detail in Book IV [of Logique des mondes]. We must here reverse Deleuze‚Äîin the sense in which, after Nietzsche, he himself wanted to reverse Plato. These are not the actions and passions of the multiples which are, under the title of an immanent result, synthesised in the event. It is the blow of an evental One which animates multiplicities and forms them into a subjectivisable body. And the trace of an event, which is itself incorporated in the new present, is clearly of the same nature as the actions of this body.
	1. **Event not resulting from actions and passions of a body**:
	    - Badiou asserts that an event is not merely a result of the actions and passions (activities and emotional responses) of a body (which can be understood as a collective or an individual). This contrasts with views that see events as outcomes of tangible and observable processes.
	2. **Nature of the event in relation to actions and passions**:
	    - The axiom stresses that the event does not differ in nature from the actions and passions of a body. This suggests a fundamental unity or equivalence in nature between what a body does and the event itself.
	3. **Event as a transformative force**:
	    - Badiou argues that an event can transform a body into an "active and adequate body in a new present." This means that following an event, a body becomes capable and effective in a newly altered reality or situation.
	4. **Reversal of Deleuze's philosophy**:
	    - The axiom explicitly states the need to reverse Gilles Deleuze's philosophy (which itself sought to reverse Plato), particularly in how Deleuze conceptualized events and multiplicities. For Deleuze, the actions and passions of entities (multiples) synthesize into an event as an immanent result. Badiou challenges this, proposing instead that it is the event that animates and organizes multiplicities into a new coherent form, which he terms a "subjectivisable body."
	5. **Evental One as the animator of multiplicities**:
	    - The "evental One" is introduced as a singular force or instance that gives life and form to multiplicities, transforming them into a unified body capable of being subjectivized (made into a subject).
	6. **Trace of the event and its incorporation**: 
	   - The axiom also speaks of the "trace of an event," which is an enduring mark or effect left by the event that becomes part of the new present. This trace is of the same nature as the actions of the body transformed by the event. Thus, the trace and the actions are intertwined, suggesting that the event's impact is continuous and embedded within the new reality of the body.

# ERRORS:

1. **Negation and Contradiction**:
    
    - Traditional dialectics, particularly Hegelian dialectics, heavily rely on the concepts of negation and contradiction to drive the process of dialectical synthesis. This process typically involves a thesis conflicting with an antithesis, resulting in a synthesis that resolves the contradiction.
    - Deleuze argued against this model because he believed that it prioritized identity and sameness over difference. For Deleuze, negation (the denial or contradiction of something) suppresses the positive reality of differences by focusing on how entities oppose or negate each other to form a higher unity.
2. **Totalization and Unity**:
    
    - Dialectics often aims at achieving some form of totality or unity, where diverse elements are ultimately reconciled within a single coherent system. The process of synthesis is supposed to overcome division and achieve higher levels of integration.
    - Deleuze, on the other hand, embraced a philosophy of pure difference and multiplicity without the need for reconciliation into unity. He viewed the desire for totalizing unity as a form of philosophical and political control that diminishes the reality of multiplicities and singularities.
3. **Teleology (End-Oriented Process)**:
    
    - Hegelian dialectics is teleological, meaning it is oriented towards a final end or goal, which is the realization of absolute knowledge or spirit. This approach assumes a predetermined direction and purpose in historical and philosophical processes.
    - Deleuze rejected this teleological approach, arguing instead for a model of becoming that is open-ended and non-directional. His philosophy emphasizes the creation of new possibilities and forms of existence without predetermined endpoints.
4. **Ontological Primacy of Identity Over Difference**:
    
    - In traditional dialectics, difference is often seen as secondary to identity; it is something to be resolved or sublated in the course of dialectical progression. The focus is on how differences can be integrated into a cohesive whole.
    - Contrarily, Deleuze posited difference itself as a fundamental category. His philosophy asserts that difference is not derivative or secondary to identity but is primary and productive. Difference drives the process of becoming and is not something to be overcome or synthesized into identity.
5. **Rejection of Representational Thought**:
    - Dialectical thinking often relies on representational thought, where concepts or entities are understood in relation to what they negate or oppose.
    - Deleuze advocated for a move away from representation towards a more dynamic and non-representational understanding of concepts and entities, emphasizing how they function and what they can do (their capacities and potentials) rather than what they are in relation to others.

It is impossible to have complex dialogues with non-polymaths if we are not high. Literally, it should be mandatory for students to smoke up before, during and after classes.

Likewise, for any serious decisions, they should be made after smoking up.

Until 2087, when regions are sufficiently upgraded, assume everyone is incapable of impactful multi-causal reasoning.

It is too dangerous for both the ecology and society for the majority of today's population to be sober and attempt to think through anything accurately.
