# Who the f--k is Mr. Amasia?

Your friendly neighborhood polymath and Church of Just Pricing prophet who is:

1. Of Amasian descent AND avowed quantumsexual (a sexual identity defined according to quantum mechanical principles) AND in terms of species, a Neganthropomorph.
2. Has a checkered past, a dark sense of absurdist humor and a bizarre set of criminal skills due to him almost becoming a world class career criminal.
3. Is trying to gain enough visibility by pulling one last art job to steal the Golden Lion from the Venice Biennale (Like the Gold Medal of the Art Olympics) and return back home — in the future.
4. His home is actually in the future — the Ethical Futures Institute of 2087 specifically — which is staffed by all Amasian quantumsexual polymaths - who are today's great grandchildren.
5. These great grandchildren are actually the ones who sent Mr. Amasia back in time, promising to clear his record if he can successfully incept 2024 with the least stupid ideas, most inclusive and healthy culture and most just prices.
