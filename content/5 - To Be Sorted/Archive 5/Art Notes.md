1. 89% of the planet cannot conceptualize planetary-scale systems accurate enough to say anything of positive impact at that scale.
2. 99.9% of the planet cannot ethically implement anything at planetary scale, including most of the 11% who can accurately say something of positive impact at planetary scale.

89% of contemporary culture is simply a coping mechanism for PTSD and dysrationalia of varying intensities.

Why not simply just heal the trauma rather than perpetuate its cyclical stupidity?

89% of the population is traumatized and should not be doing anything that is not simply just healing themselves. There's only 3 things that can be done.

1. Sell treatment to the population in various forms.
2. Pre-emptively defuse fascism and build transregional infrastructure.
3. Identify, protect and work with untraumatized individuals and groups.
