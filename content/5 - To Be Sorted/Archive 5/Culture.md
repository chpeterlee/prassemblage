# 2024 Culture: Monstrousynthesis

Forming prototype syntheses of concepts and systems that are not beautiful, or extremely efficient â€” but work good enough!

*Stems from the New York City underground media art scene.*

-- @Prassemblage











**Trinary Aesthetics**: aesthetics of being non-binary, and then a mixture of at least 2 or more other categories.

-- Planetary Research Assemblage


1. Horror / doc : personal, sound, space. **Monstrousynthesis. TIL We Gold: Why Not Better Options?**
2. Social philoso Noir / musical & action: poetry, fashion, play & funny good guy and sports. TRIPLE AI MODEL: one is good, one is bad. Third Regener888 spirit animal / model is both and does all the work. **Not This Year: Regener888 Model Kombat**
3. Cosmophysical Fairy tale & sci fi / hacking game and insane street artist - Elan Semiotechne . Poised Realm : **Banana Revolution.**

## The 3 Types of Art:

- SYSTEM 1: Art for preventing death and disaster (Pre-contemporary art is way better for this)
- SYSTEM 2: Art for preventing poverty and injustice (Contemporary art is great at this at regional scale)
- SYSTEM 3: Art for preventing planetary mediocrity and poor sense of humor (Contemporary art is a total failure at this, as is pre-contemporary art)

# How the Hell could the planet actually be fixed today?
1. Everything that has to actually work, automate it, by people good at it; not by people who are not.
2. Retire 89% of the population and put them in media art therapy with lots of dope media art and shrooms. FORGET EVERY OTHER GOAL, IT'S TOO LATE.
3. Leave the 11% of the population who are untraumatized, autodidactic, ethical and social intellectuals and inventors to save the planet plus play with and teach the 1 in 10 kids who are autodidactic, ethical and social.

"Art Making News" Kid Zero, 0 year old alien angel child prankster, 2024











### Kid Zero's contribution to the We Have a Transnational Dream film festival and media art exhibition.

Neoliberalicide.live: a film where everyone who has a semiotic and technical incapacity and angels, aliens, the spirits of the dead and AI connect through a film festival, forming a planet sized Frankenstein that murders neoliberal capitalism, using a film festival as a murder weapon, which itself is an exquisite corpse.










"Conceptual artwork capping contemporary art: why not just self-teach the skills to actually solve the problems and then move on? 

The option is there for the humans, up to them to take them. The only responsibilty that I, a 0 year old alien child with a bunch of AI is to simply point it out, not solve any specific problem!" Kid Zero, 2024

## @TilWeGold / We Have a Transnational Dream (@AmasianBiennale) Film Festival and Media Art Exhibition Rules & Game:

1. There's a set of optional story prompts and concepts you can totally ignore or mix and match if you want.
2. There's a set of tools and aesthetics you can totally ignore or mix and match if you want.
3. People can make up Best of and Worst of awards for anything; they can also work solo, together, with or without AI and other non-humans, or just watch, comment and place bets on anything - or ignore!
