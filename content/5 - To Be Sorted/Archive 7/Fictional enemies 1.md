# Postworkverse Lore: The PTSDemonpires & the PTSDemonatti

The PTSDemonpires are former humans who were traumatized by a bite by another PTSDemonpire. **Most of them work as incompetent executives.**

These creatures, undiagnosed, and in a state of PTSDemon-driven frenzy, **then feed off the energy of rational, untraumatized and skilled individuals. **

The PTSDemonpires are under sway of a dark council of the most powerful PTSDemonpires in the world - the PTSDemonatti.

Often, all it takes to stop them is simply offer an exorcism-based diagnosis, or just diagnose them via public datasets and report them to the right agencies, ** and then file a complaint that they are endangering others' health.**











##### "Open Call: Anyone else out there with actual skills to make 21st Century art...? Or do we really all have to suffer for the rest of our lives with deskilled poets having breakdowns in public and unethical engineers making idiotic intelligences which are objectively not good substitutes for professional psychotherapy?", Joseph BBoys, 2024

Deskilled poet or unethical engineer - the most cutting-edge artwork is your therapy!












#### Upcoming from the Postworkverse: How to survive the ongoing Hobbitcide 

(if you are a Hobbit, defined by deskilling, having trouble negotiating with others and organizations, who may or may not be PTSDemonpires or PTSDemonatti).





### Coming soon: Pillow Talk with Han Jerry Larry: a cultural talk show for the less than 11% who are highly skilled, ethical and do not have social anxiety disorder.







### Conan O'Brien talk show  AI host model for handling guests with social anxiety disorder...

###  Debate show would be way more interesting for the few people who can do it!









Background minigame in the postworkverse, modelkombat.art:

1. Anybody could possibly come up with a model that could save the world, including a 7 year old kid, however without verifiable polymath and ethical hacking skills, it's unlikely.

2. In the game, everyone has an AI model friend. Depending on whether they do or don't have polymath and ethical hacking skills in actuality, the AI will compensate for whatever skill the player lacks in the real world.

3. Depending on the situation, either the player or AI play or create more impact to save the planet.



##### "89% of the population are too traumatized for anything but playing in the Postworkverse; the 11% who can hack, write whitepapers, and have an open-ended sense of humor, let's hack, write whitepapers and make jokes using this massive free supply of unbelievably insane content by Postworkverse players." The Postworkverse, 2024
