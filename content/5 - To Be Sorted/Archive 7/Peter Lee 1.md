an artwork, cult and political party that pre-emptively just believes in the most inclusively scalable solutions to accurately phrased problems, regardless of whether the inclusively scalable solution comes from the Left, the Right or your mom. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Of course, being an artwork, and not an actually boringly incompetent political committee, it's processes of proposal, simulation and verification are open-ended." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

"**Your mom is my medium, and super avant garde world-saving hyperobject sculpture. Take me to your mom. There isn't much time left."** Chongha Peter Lee, 2024






##### Coming soon: Future Dead Friends Club Philosoton seminar #SeasonofReason sale! 

**With world-infamous Chongha Peter Lee, aka the Rick Rubin of contemporary art and critical culture, the biggest antifragile asshole in the world who cares about you (think of House, M.D.).**

**Contemporary art, for the most part, is like a giant nursery; it reduces and freezes humans into fragile infants -** **not into the good, healthy, playful creative children, but sick, psychopathic, fucked up kids that spread rumors about each other and torture small animals.** 

**Peter is the only contemporary artist in the world who did not submit to the individuals with toxic Dysrationalia** **that comprise contemporary art, saved a bunch of their lives and exorcised demons from them.**

Profits go to non-bullsh-t magic-as-f--k ‚ú®Ô∏è contemporary art that verifiably prevents vulnerable people from dying, versus your run-of-the-mill bullshit art that does jack sh-t. üí©

##### Upcoming: Future Dead Friends Club #Philosoton seminars with world-infamous a--hole polymath artist who cares about you (like Dr. House, M.D.), Chongha Peter Lee.
1. You've been educated in contemporary art which was new in the 90's - **it's 30 f-cking years old now.** **You did great then, you're clearly useless now, and worse - you're turning into the neoliberal monsters you used to fight.**
2. **You have all these unconscious reflexes that make you interpret the world clearly inaccurately, destructively and most importantly, stupidly.**
3. **99% of younger artists are traumatized, have some mental disorder and are terrified to do anything that f-cks up their income because they are so deskilled.** **What the f-ck do you do now?**

##### PHILOSOTON 101 (21st Century Fitness): OKAY, before we can start living in the 21st Century, we have to make peace with the 20th and pre-20th. Here's 3 books that are the Spirit of the 20th Century, and any contemporary art related to it, is automatically salvageable:

1. **AFFECT:** Gabriel Marquez's 100 Years of Solitude.
2. **PERCEPT:** Kafka's Metamorphosis.
3. **CONCEPT:** Jorge Luis Borges' Library of Aleph

We will be working out and dieting while reading these! Bring your best self!




##### "Case Studies Demonstrating the Flail-and-Fail Limitations of Contemporary Art and a Bet Against Trevor Paglen, With the Hope of Being Wrong, (thus rejecting nihilism and opening up for a more poetic, impactful and complex Post-contemporary Art. Guys, come on, we can do better than this.) by Chongha Peter Lee:

1. **Laurie Anderson's** 2021 Hirschhorn exhibition response to the pandemic. While the level of poetry was great, it was absolutely devoid of a dimension  of accuracy and structure which could not only address the losses, tragedies and organizational failures - but make more complex and impactful poetry.
2. **Hito Steyerl's withdrawal at Documenta 2022**; nobody being able to parse and accurately judge if it was warranted or not.
3. **Tania Bruguera's** recent, in my opinion, utterly disastrous performance in Germany. IF its function was not simply to provoke, but actually arbitrate. If it was simply a provocation, like a 1970's era conceptual performance piece re-performed by a 2024 undergraduate student as a class assignment, then success.
4. UPCOMING: **Trevor Paglen's moving image piece on psy-ops**, which, Chongha Peter Lee bets is going to be an utter **flail-and-fail** due to an absolutely predictable semiotechnical illiteracy which plagues contemporary art from top to bottom, but hopefully not, because God knows culture needs a f--king kick in the ass today. Anything good is better than the f--king mediocre sh-tshow we have today." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024






**"Chongha Peter Lee: player and now art coach for the official transregional sport of the Neganthropocene Summit - Fairy Tale Deal Ball üèÄ
1. **Fairy Tale Deal Ball** is played by spirits, aliens, AI, ethical hackers and polymath artists.
2. The entire game is to win points by proposing, implementing and regulating better **Fairy Tale Deals** for any possible situation. **Play solo or on teams!**" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024
**THE FTDBA mandates that if a player is psychologically injured, similar to physical injuries, they will not be allowed to play in strenuous conceptual games. Instead, they will be directed to a professional to take some time off and rehabilitate.**

## Good New









## Good news! Everyone who needs therapy will soon be able to talk to one of the coolest healers on Earth - OZAN ATALAN - and raise money to protect vulnerable individuals who are objectively in more danger than you! 





##### 1. What contemporary art is absolutely incapable of: 
solving any real world problems. Really, anything to do with reality = üëé. 
##### 2. What is it actually capable of? Basically, making interesting stories! Contemporary art is fundamentally just good writing. Get good at writing, super easy to make solid conceptual painting and sculpture. 
The best contemporary art is simply just riffs off of 20th Century literature, cinema and phenomenology - because these are the only skills those artists have.
##### 3. That's it, don't try anything else, you'll either commit suicide or end up f--king up someone else's life. 
Also get therapy if you need it, don't expect it from art; if you do, odds are you'll commit suicide and/or f--k someone else up.








**### The easiest image of what the field of today's contemporary art and Humanities is: a field filled primarily by individuals who have forms of mental disorders that prevent them from being able to think with math and logic**



**Contemporary Art and Humanities is an ecologies selecting individuals who are talented only in language and images;** **unfortunately, an accurate navigation of reality requires math and literacy of various functions.**

This is also why the psychoses and breakdowns are easily predictable. **How hard is it to predict that a car with 2 wheels is going to have trouble turning?**

This is also why it's pointless to expect it to actually impact today's problems. **The skills simply aren't there.**








**Today's Contemporary Art + Humanities-related fields = imagine a car with 2 wheels.**
