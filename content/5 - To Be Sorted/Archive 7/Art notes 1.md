### "Homages to Mid-level Art Heroes Who are Self-Aware Enough to Know They Don't Have the Skills, Sanity and Ethics for Higher-level Art, and Aren't Childish Assholes About It" Jean Goddammard, Laconic Postworking Class Horse, 2024







#### "There is zero-complexity art and complex art; that's all. 

#### There's absolutely no need for anyone with a modicum of intelligence to make zero-complexity art - children, evolution and insane people are way better at it! And they do it for free!" Catpatia Piper, 2024






##### "There's not enough money, skill, sanity and audience for artists to make world class art. Why waste your life trying? Focus on your region, forget the planet. If you can't hack or actually do philosophy, it's a waste of your time. 99% of artists are slackers, stoners and nerds, just act like it! It's fine! If you tried to save the planet you'd fuck it all up and we'd all fucking die! You can barely cook toast without burning the fucking house down!" üêà Catpatia Piper the Neon Madonna, 2024






##### "If you're not traumatized and you're not a polymath, there's a 99% chance you should be in a community of regional scale artists, not trying to make planetary impact or engage in outdated art markets filled with mentally ill individuals, sadly just being pumped and dumped like some abused child movie star and not in a clinic receiving proper care." Jean Godammard, 2024







##### There's 2 tried and true ways to enter the larger art market, which are not good for anyone who is not f--ked up beyond all repair or a verified polymath:

1. You ***sell mental illness, sex and drugs*** to a bunch of equally mentally ill but richer people.
2. You're a verified polymath and **can ethically hack the planet.**
##### Look, if you're so f--ked you need to play the mental illness, sex and drugs card - do it.
-- Catpatia Piper






###### The art world cannot possibly produce any impact; the individuals are deskilled, mentally ill and exploitative.

###### However, because of this, it's actually quite a strong model of how to take the most vulnerable parts of society and construct a postwork life support machine, where you plug the vulnerable bodies in and then keep them alive longer. 

**It's just a social safety net! Everything else is just icing on the cake.**

-- üêà Catpatia Piper








##### In 2024, art doesn't produce art; it produces a postwork social safety net that keeps people who would otherwise be dead, alive.

Paradoxically, functional postwork prototypes for the most vulnerable bodies is actually one of the most significant and foundational artworks of the 21st Century.

-- Catpatia Piper








###### Fragile people need fragile-friendly postwork life support, such as the art world; if you send them elsewhere, it's a death sentence for them.

**The art world is a foundational model for a postwork industrial revolution**, which is not premised on the function of producing intellectual and infrastructural paradigm shifts (**which is better done by polymaths and ethical hackers**) - but simply healing the most damaged parts of the planet's social soil, composed of the **mentally ill, deskilled and socially traumatized**.

-- ü¶Ö Elan Eagle Semiotechne ü¶Ö, the clinically insane eagle, being observed in the Section 11 mental ward, running for president.





###### In various industrial revolutions, you will see that the transition to a new mode of cultural and economic production creates death counts higher than the Holocaust. 

###### As the planet transitions into an impact-based infrastructural economy, there's a massive risk of needless death. Art can serve as a postwork life support system for the deskilled, mentally ill, and traumatized, keeping them alive instead of just murdering them, as is standard procedure in history.

-- Elan Semiotechne 





Currently, the majority of humans are so deskilled that they can only:
1. Manipulate physical objects within arms reach.
2. Think a maximum of 3 steps.
3. Cannot independently organize without a pre-established decades old protocol, or highly immersive game environment.
**The most powerful resource of the majority of humans is not their consciousness, it's their subconscious.** There are blind, associative leaps that can be executed that is difficult for the limitations of today's AI. 99% of these are useless, but 1% are accurate and can save immense amounts of computation. 
-- Elan Semiotechne





#### Without analytical skill, it's pointless to teach an individual. 

###### The more information they are exposed to, with the less ability to organize it, the more it will skew their mental map, and the more you put them at risk. It's better for them not to know, than to know and make immense, catastrophic errors. 

-- Elan Semiotechne 





##### It's more important for most humans to engage in postwork play and psychedelics without expectations, rather than engage in complex, accurate abstraction and problem solving. 

Those who can self-teach, already self-teach, so there's no need to teach them. 

Those who can't self-teach, should not be troubled. **Let them live a little.**

-- Elan Semiotechne 




##### Why would safe postwork play spaces and psychedelics be critical infrastructure for society?

**Because most humans, when given complex problems requiring accuracy and skill, would destroy everything.** If you don't put these humans in a safe, trivial environment, they will become mentally ill and start destroying things. 

If earlier ages utilized coloseums and entertainment, today we need to use play and psychedelics to distract and prevent downward health spirals creating real catastrophes.

-- Elan Semiotechne 






##### Why not just badge everyone who has the sanity, skills and ethics to actually positively impact the planet, and everyone else simply just plays and lives it up a bit more?

Guys why stress yourself about shit you'll never be able to do, **and more importantly**,**don't actually give a shit about.** 

**Go get therapy, do healthier drugs and party a bit!**

-- Elan Semiotechne

##### Easiest solution to cut through the Gordian Knot of inertia in today's arts and Humanities fields: Simply diagnose 95% of it with various mental illnesses and extrapolate their endangerment to others, thus directing them to postwork safe spaces and zero impact processes; then have skill, ethics and impact based tests and valuations for the remaining portion.

-- Elan Semiotechne








# Placemaking Your Bets No. 3688 by üêà Catpatia Piper:

If today's art world got a professional psychosocial evaluation, 90% would be diagnosed with PTSD imparing function.

Why endanger these clearly vulnerable and dysfunctional individuals with a cult of production? **Tell them SELF-AWARE INACTION, HARM PREVENTION and SUBCONSCIOUS DREAMING is the most heroic action in the Postworkverse.** **True postwork heroes!** LESS IS MORE.







###### The most understandable metaphor for what today's art world is right now is an addicted smoker who knows they should quit smoking, makes huge rants cursing smoking, knows every single fact of why to quit, but is unlikely to actually do so. Why not just let them have a pleasant life until death?

-- üêà Catpatia Piper üêà 









##### "To continue to live another day without suicide and homocide despite one's clear function-impairing PTSD is an act of Postworkverse heroism. Congratulations!" Catpatia Piper, 2024







**"Placemaking Your Bets No. 367 by
üò∫ Catpatia Piper, pataphysical cat artist, curator and theorist for an art project produced for the Neganthropocene Summit:**

Relative to the Anthropocene and Capitalocene framework, the Neganthropocene theoretical framework addresses deficiencies in technological and transcultural literacies, promising more positive impact for the majority of the the art and Humanities community members, moreso than the Anthropocene discourse; additionally a large number of this community could potentially be diagnosed to be suffering from function-impairing PTSD, thus benefiting from postwork advocacy and occupational therapy." 

üêà **Catpatia Piper, 2024**











# "The Impactcene" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024







##### "The art and Humanities community is simply an incredibly robust self-organizing PTSD postwork shelter; why disturb it with accuracy, complexity and impact? It's like walking on to a children's basketball court and slam dunking on 7 year olds. It's great at what it does, not what it doesn't. " üê¥ Jean Godammard, 2024








##### Good news! Healing division is being designated with very vibe-literate people; everyone who is traumatized will be redirected from **the extremely boring and much less cool and unfashionable work** of making complex paradigm shifts!

-- Catpatia Piper









### "Art coach here. There's 2 fundamental different skill levels in art:

###### 1. The Art Olympics

###### 2. The Art Special Olympics

Outside the game, you want NBA players hanging out and talking to the Special Olympics basketball players - because everyone is a human.

You do NOT want the NBA players playing an actual game against the Special Olympics players for high stakes! That's ridiculous!"
Chongha Peter Lee, 2024






#### "Placemaking Your Bets by Catpatia Piper:

People With Trauma, Therapists and Psychiatrists, Intuitively Have More Interesting and Healing Conversations and Lives With Each Other Rather Than the Non-traumatized, Because It's More Authentic and Genuine" Catpatia Piper, 2024









##### "Conceptual Performance: If you are traumatized, have a mental disorder, a therapist or psychiatrist, Peter connects you with others so you can have more authentic conversations together than with someone who can't imagine the pain of others, and empathize so amazingly, such as yourself." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024







NEXT:

1. Few polymath individuals: wagers, hacking, whitepapers.
2. Mid-level individuals : postwork play partners, psychedelics & jokes.
3. Mass culture: AI guided role models.






### "Traumatized nerds, the long-awaited day approaches when you are free of your tormentor Peter!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024








##### "Bet: if you're in the Humanities and you are not a polymath or ethical hacker, psychotherapy via the arts, psychedelics and postwork occupational therapy will be better at addressing your dysrationalia, social anxiety disorder and PTSD, moreso than knowledge production and art production. In doing so you will reduce the harm to yourself and others." Dr. Hao, 2024
