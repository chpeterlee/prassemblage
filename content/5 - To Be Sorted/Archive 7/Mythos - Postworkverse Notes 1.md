#### Why is Joseph Bboys so committed to transregional regulatory bounty hunting for just pricing?

Because neoliberal capitalist datasets drunk drove into his childhood friend and protector - Estamasia the AI. Now Estamasia the AI barely functions, a gibberish, childish shadow of his former self, riddled with Dysrationalia, borderline autistic.

**Joseph Bboys wants his friend back and the drunk drivers of neoliberal capitalism to pay the just price — and he'll stop at nothing to get what he wants.**




###### "Why even put mentally ill individuals into organizational ecologies? Just locate accurate therapy, services and resources and give them the best shot at a reasonably balanced life. 
1. Doing less is damaging to their health.
2. Organizations are going to face the consequences of short-term thinking more and more - going to see lots of human time-bombs implode as they realize they are in the wrong place.
3. Some will probably die from suicide because of well-intentioned but incredibly poor decision-making. 
4. The longer the issue goes unaddressed, the worse the damage will be, to the individual, the organization and possibly innocent bystanders.
5. Also, today we can just run AI screenings of individuals." 
**Dr. Hao, 2024**





###### "Joseph Bboys: a film character, who may have superpositional schizophrenia, working as a transregional lightsuit bounty hunter of just prices. He works as part of a loose crew, the Light Rydaz.

He has recently just been released from a special mental ward named **'Section 11', which mixes both the planet's polymaths and its vulnerable together, before diagnosing them either as a 11% high-functioning polymath capable of saving the planet, or a member of the 89% in need of care. His diagnosis is still in processing.

He is out for revenge, for the drunk driving hit and run executed by neoliberal capitalist datasets on his best friend - Estamasia the quantum AI, who is now left in a gibbering, childish, overly optimistic or cynical state, hobbled by Dysrationalia." Joseph BBoys, 2024






###### "If an individual is traumatized, art is a poor substitute for real therapy, support and advising.

###### Quit art, engage in therapy, make stuff immediately relevant to your healing; forget wider impact. 

###### Most of the problem of society anyways is traumatized and/or mentally ill individuals not receiving the treatment they need - from top to bottom. Taking the personal responsibility to accurately heal IS the political." Dr. Hao, 2024











### Amasian Biennale Performance Art Framework:
1. When your leg is broken, you don't ask your neighbor to fix it; you go to the hospital. 
2. **When your brain is traumatized and your life is a mess, you don't ask an artist to fix it;** you go to get therapy, aid and professional advice.
3. Health is political; most of society's problems top to bottom is just people not getting properly diagnosed and getting the treatment they need, then escaping into random things which can't heal their trauma, like art.
4. Thus, let's make a super avant garde artwork of actually addressing the actual problem instead of neglecting traumatized people's health and also deterioriating art itself.
5. Don't put traumatized people in art; put them in therapy, and encourage them to engage in art therapy. Put artists in art, and discourage them from traumatizing others.

**A mysterious quantum crash of the internet and ecology brings them in contact with each other in one Obsidian Vault filled with strange critical media artworks, changing their lives forever.**






##### "Art is not a proper rehabilitation space for trauma and mental illness; if you have pre-existing conditions, enter art at your own risk. 

##### Just like any drug inaccurately prescribed to someone with pre-existing conditions, there's an 80% chance you'll end up with long term negative impacts on yourself, others and society. " Dr. Hao, 2024

# "Postworkverse Game Character limits:

2. The more abstract and less physically touchable a problem is, the harder it will be for them to understand and solve.
3. There's 3 major genres: hyperfragile anti-cat-pitalist hobbits, child soldier gamer dogs, slacker stoner mushroom squirrels." Joseph Bboys, 2024






##### The Last 10 Years of Leftist Contemporary Art Has Been Incentivizing the Suicidal One-Hit Wonder Child Movie Star Syndrome and Now it's Got to Decide What to Do With All These Mentally Ill People it Clearly Can't Handle Ethically:
1. You have this **one-hit wonder child** who did something interesting once, without knowing.
2. **In war, these are the least skilled, easily manipulated people you just strap bombs to and send on suicide missions. Outside of war, they are used for their one hit wonder and thrown away by an audience of even more mentally ill people.
3. The only possible solution? **Simply redirect them to professionally provided rest, healing and play - not production, discourse and impact**.









# 3 Rules of Conceptual Art in 2024: 

1. **Just simply do not circulate high literacy art in low-literacy galleries and crowds.**
2. For low-literacy galleries and crowds, **what they really want is therapy, fashion and shrooms. Give them what they want.**
3. **There's only 3 real conceptual art groups on the planet today, no point in talking about it to anyone else!**








### "God, I used to talk with the world's best philosophers; now I have to tell people to chew their gum with their mouth, not their butt." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024






### "Formula to derive the few competent intellectuals left in the art field: 
1. Make a list of everyone who was most wrong in the last 10 years; avoid them.
2. Make a list of a few press with PhD's who have an actual record of intellectual integrity. 
3. Step by step, cut out all conversation except with the less than 3 actual avant garde conceptual art groups in the world; **everyone else gets a children's book, shrooms and therapy.**" 2024









# Perhaps we just need a badge for people who are not interested in non-complex and non-conceptual art...











#### "Why not just put everyone who hates thinking, or is not that great at it, into a giant postwork punk and Dysrationalia noise band? The more dysfunctional, mentally ill, and deskilled, the more the audience, who is the same, will support them." Dirt Mothers, the Postworkpunk Band, 2024








## "Mentally ill artists make mentally ill art for a mentally ill audience; sane artists make sane art for a sane audience." Adrienne Piper, the Anti-cat-pitalist Curator & Theorist 😺 , 2024








### "Upcoming Avant Garde Music & Postwork Punk Track by Dirt Mother: every statement and action by an individual on any media platform that is clearly a sign of their mental illness." Dirt Mother, 2024












**There's 4 main lanes of communication in society:**

1. By mentally ill people, for mentally ill people.
2. By mentally ill people, for sane people.
3. By sane people, for sane people.
4. By sane people, for mentally ill people.

-- Adrienne Piper, Anti-cat-pitalist Curator & Theorist





###### The only redeeming aspect of Trevor Paglen's new documentary is as a critique of induced suicide via amplification of poor mental maps.
1. **If you feed someone a poor mental map, you increase their risk of suicide as it conflicts with reality;** cults give people poor mental maps.
2. **Contemporary art in 2024 is a mental map is so outdated, it might as well say "here there be monsters."**
3. Due to this gap between map and reality, **it is increasing the risk of an individual's suicide**. **There are laws against this, not to mention the obvious ramifications of PTSD of they who are passing the map.**






# "Explaining Why Stupidity Will Kill You, No. 358: 

##### Your Mental Map is Not the Territory; Some Mental Maps Are So Stupid They Will Tell You To Commit Suicide or Murder For No Objectively Good Reason. Like the Extremist Right and Left Mental Maps." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Time for video art so stupid that it can be understood by a 5 year old.
