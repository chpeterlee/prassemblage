##### "Ongoing Conceptual Performance Artwork by Chongha Peter Lee: being an antifragile artist individual, as opposed to your run-of-the-mill mentally ill, toxic fragile artist, and actually solving systemic issues systematically. Then demanding an accurate amount of visibility, access and resources befitting a given fair deal or better, fairy tale deal, including declaring other artists mentally ill and unfit for particular tasks, and redirecting them to what they can do. If these demands are not meant, the appropriate resources will simply be taken. Thus Peter can accurately claim being the only fucking artist in the world who's actually doing a goddamn fucking thing and not cowering in fear and shoving their fucking head up their fucking ass and simply spiraling into absolutely trivial entropy and inevitable suicide. üëç " Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Goodbye, beach escape plan dream, a la 90's crime movie, it was good knowing you for the past few years.
