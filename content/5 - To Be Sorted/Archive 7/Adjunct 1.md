#### "WorldWar0.cloud: an art film, model and peace game of all out fully automated quantum war on neoliberal capitalism, ending it by any means necessary.

### "Avant garde performance art: All traumatized people praying, self-caring, journalling and making art letters to the gods of NGO'S and non profits to provide the therapy, social work and legal advising, health care, housing and just prices they need" Dr. Hao, 2024



##### "Why put mentally ill people into art, when they should be in rehab healing? If you push traumatized individuals to function, they will kill themselves and hurt others.
1. If you put them in art, they will receive poor care and destroy the cultural ecosystem and be unhappy because they will perceive this subconsciously. 
2. Just put them in rehab so they can heal, including using art therapy separately, paid by health insurance.
3. Then fund and support impact-based art for ecosocial balance of regions separately." 

Dr. Hao, 2024
