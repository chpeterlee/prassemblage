1. The traumatized can keep each other alive by confirming that the condition of trauma is real.
2. Rarely do the traumatized actually heal the traumatized because they don't have the capacity, skills and resources to parse and deliver proper dosages of affect, percept and concept.
3. Also, it's only recently in human history that this was even possible to measure accurately, per context; hence there's very little expectation of a massive, sudden shift. 
4. **The better goal is to simply construct situations and mechanisms to produce less frequent negative states in the traumatized over time.**
5. However what's most likely going to happen is people are going to bang around like pool balls, many will die unnecessarily, many will exploit, abuse and predate on each other and many will simply fall ill. **Until a fully automated dopamine management regimen is constructed, at least a few will be less miserable.**





###### Dr. Hao's preliminary notes for their Neoliberalicide.live investigative report series on PostworkTV.art : your society basically crashed into your brain with a truck, which is why you are traumatized and mentally ill. EAT SHROOMS üçÑ AND POSTWORK.

1. Just like a physical car crash, you are owed an insurance payment. 
2. Instead of being a ticking human time bomb and then imploding inside of organizations presuming functional individuals, go claim your insurance payment and get healed.
3. Forget trying to be a working member of society or solving its bigger problems until you are healed. **Your health is the most avant garde sculpture and performance art in the world.** **AWAKEN YOUR POSTWORKING CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS.** üçÑ 






### Dr. Hao's prescription for the Dysrationalia mental health epidemic of 2024, particularly afflicting the Humanities, social and cultural services sector:

1. Identify individuals who are mentally ill.
2. Quarantine them to prevent them from doing actual damage; easier to just put them in a virtual space to destroy, which will be less work and cost than rehabilitation.
3. Transition them to safe spaces and non-critical work. Refocus them on healing and therapy. Help them claim damages done to them by organizations.
4. **Identify the few groups in the Humanities, social and cultural services who are high functioning.
5. **Task them with producing postwork conditions before a bigger humanitarian crisis comes.**






### Dr. Hao's prescription for the Dysrationalia mental health epidemic of 2024 afflicting various sectors:

1. **Identify mentally ill individuals and place them in virtual safe spaces with adequate access to care and services.**
2. Identify non-mentally ill individuals and pay them to produce postwork infrastructure.







#### Dr. Hao's diagnosis:
1. Your society is a car üöó. This car rear-ended your brain at birth and has been continuously crashing into you since.
2. This is why you are traumatized and have various forms of the mental illness known as Dysrationalia.
3. **Stop attempting to participate in public concerns and spaces. Seek care and services in safe spaces where you cannot damage yourself or others.** 
4. **You are owed damages from corporations and governments. Work with advocates to claim payment.**
5. Law can be used to regulate Dysrationalia in society from top to bottom, **especially preventing damage to children.**
