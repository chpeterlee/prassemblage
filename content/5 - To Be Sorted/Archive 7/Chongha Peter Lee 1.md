##### **Contemporary Art Redefined for 2024 (You Need Complex Experiences, Not Jesus or Saving the World)**
0. **Forget:** forget saving the world, forget high stakes action, forget intellectualism and invention.
1. **To get paid:** call it regional modelling.
2. **What people actually want from contemporary art**: good drugs, cinema and parties.
3. **What people actually need long term:** complex experiences producing ethical happiness.
4. **How to get things done:** Anything that needs to work or people will die - automate it; anything that people desire - transform it into a critical form; anything that's a super inclusive and scalable solution - spread.

### "Peter joining some laughably exploited adjunct position at a university specifically as a salt - someone intentionally going into an organization to organize its workers, giving zero fucks about the job." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

### The üéÆ Game Guide to Peter's million instagram accounts and covert counter-psy-ops network aka the Children's Intelligence Agency (it's a joke):

**System 1 (70% of the population):** 1 line, crass, street jokes about politics and nice normal person family stuff.

**System 2 (17% of the population)** : Small digestible bites of critical conceptual mediaregional culture, capping out at contemporary art level literacy (no deep knowledge of philosophy and science and tech required).

**System 3 (11% of the population)** : fun, incredibly complex and accurate pataphysical dialogues and theater with fictional characters and AI.
