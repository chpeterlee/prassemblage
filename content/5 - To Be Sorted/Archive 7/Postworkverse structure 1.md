 **If They Were Not Cognitively Dysfunctionalized Due to Viral Demon Possession, They Would Be Working Together to Effectively Sue and Receive Damage Payments From the 1%**; Clearly They Are Medically Unfit For Healthy Politics, And A Few Good Non-Humans Must Advocate on Their Behalf " @JosephBboys Coyote Saint of the Postworkverse 2024‚Ä¶

3. Peter does whitepapers, ethical hacking, and planetary-scale art.
