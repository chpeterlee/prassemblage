# Announcement by Captain Amasia üêá, State of the Decolonies Address:

1. Lots of good things have happened, will sit down and make an update.
2. Lots of good stuff can be done today that was impossible before.
3. This year, many more asses will be saved, regions will be balanced, workers will be organized, and Kid Zero's favorite, **bad people will be destroyed, spectacularly.**

# UPCOMING: Quantum Raves, Riots, Cult Weddings, Films and Performance Art!

-- Kid Zero aka DJ UNIONIZE







###### "Ongoing Conceptual Art Performance for the Amasian Biennale: Chongha Peter Lee attempts to track down his own ethical future fugitive model, who has murdered neoliberal capitalism in the ethical future, with 3 artworks, and framed him for the crime.

###### The ethical future fugitive model is comprised of 3 non-binary Amasian quantum characters: 
1. The honest Captain Amasia / Detective Crowlee
2. The vibey DJ Unionize / Kid Zero
3. The heady Dr. Hao / Quantumstein

Each character is open source, and can be played by multiple individuals." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024






# How you know it's art for 2024: it is 80% rave and riot, 20% ethical hacking and extremely clever conceptual prank.







## "I am not the shooter; I am merely the bullet, fired 500 years ago in superpositional self-defense by the Amasian Peoples, now blowing out the brains of neoliberal capitalism at superluminal speeds." Kid Zero, 2024









##### "Catpatia's Target Audience: Not the clearly mentally ill contemporary artists who take 1 f-cking year to learn a single new f-cking idea - but their kids, who clearly see all their flaws and are trying desperately to learn how not to be so f--king mentally ill. " üò∫ Catpatia Piper üò∫ , artist, curator and theorist, 2024

Guys, if you take AN ENTIRE FUCKING YEAR TO LEARN 1 IDEA, don't fucking bother making conceptual art - play punk music. 







# "Thought Experiment for Contemporary Art by Catpatia Piper:

1. Imagine actual cosmophysical knowledge of the planet is a metaphorical mountain ‚õ∞Ô∏è. (Mount Neganthropocene)
2. At the peak, is obtaining enough cosmophysical knowledge that you can act ethically as an individual, upon the planet.
3. Most of contemporary art people, even the top tier ones, **like Trevor Paglen and Hito Steyerl,** are stuck halfway up the mountain.
4. **If you haven't made it to the top by now, you're probably not going to make it; also, if you try to rush you the mountain, the pressure will cause your head to explode and you'll commit suicide.**
5. **It is better to form friends and communities in the middle, anchored by competent travel guides, and make slow progress up the mountain over the next decade, watching each other to prevent suicide and cannibalism.**" üêà Catpatia Piper, 2024





###### "Catpatia Piper's Thought Experiment of Contemporary Artists: Imagine someone trying to climb Mount Everest, except thinking that it's a pleasant beach with full amenities, and they're telling every person they meet along the way to invest all their money on this trip to the amazing Mt. Everest beach escape, swim in the warm salt water, and have the best mojitos and shrimp on the planet, cooked in the traditional Mt. Everest island tradition." Catpatia Piper, 2024
