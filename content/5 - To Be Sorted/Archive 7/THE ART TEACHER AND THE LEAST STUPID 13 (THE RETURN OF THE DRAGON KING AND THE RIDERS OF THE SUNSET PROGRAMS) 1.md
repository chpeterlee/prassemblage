(A Decolonial Western Revenge Film Ending the 500 Year Old World War 0 by Murdering Neoliberal Capitalism and Winning the Transregional Fairy Tale Deal Ball Championships of Amasia, After Being Tested By Close Individuals in Model Kombat, Then Recruited Into the Least Stupid 13, to Steal the Golden Lion From the Venice Biennale)"

Chongha Peter Lee intentionally takes a ridiculous job as an adjunct in a sunset program, with the only goal being to organize a worker's rebellion, rally zillenial adjuncts, Gen Z riots, Gen X networks and a few good boomer investors across the planet, all in a last ditch effort to to make a decolonial Western revenge film ending the 500 year old war, World War 0, by murdering neoliberal capitalism, winning the transregional Fairy Tale Deal Championships of Amasia, no doubt having to prove himself in multiple rounds of Model Kombat, who after bringing the fights to a balance, makes an open offer to his opponents to join the Least Stupid 13, a team of the most insane people on Earth, to steal the Golden Lion from the Venice Biennale, thus bringing forth the Banana Revolution and the Regulatory Rapture.








##### Place Your Bets No. 339 by Kid Zero (clearly an alien from outer space and Children's Intelligence Agency operative, having no clue what they're talking about)

1. **Toxic masculinity and toxic fragility are two sides of the same coin of toxic Dysrationalia**.
2. Both are the same logical error; incapacity to ethically and accurately negotiate as peers.
3. Hence, this is more of a mental health issue; for various socio-economic-historical reasons, both sides are simply suffering an illness causing these behaviors.
4. Health is Political; not only that it IS THE POLITICAL CENTER. Both Left and Right are sick and require treatment.
5. On the grounds of health we can sort through the ridiculous wrecked state today's culture is in.

# Coming soon by the Emergent Centers: The Price is NOT Right Gameshow!

Talk shit about prices, **like adjunct contracts or pretty much any working class contract with respect to the costs of living**, that are not right, with you, spirits, aliens, and AI and polymaths.
