### Open Call for the 11% of the Planet Who Is an Independent Polymath/Ethical Hacker

1. Hypothetically, 1/10 individuals are imaginative, ethical and skilled enough to self-teach to planetary level... where the f--k are they...?
2. Maybe just put out an ad in the papers for other independent polymaths and ethical hackers...?


# üêà Catpatia Piper Says There's 3 Types of Art:
1. Zero or negative impact art (72%) (9/10 people have some form of PTSD, Social Anxiety Disorder and Dysrationalia; most art is necessary art therapy.)
2. Low-impact art (17%) (Strategy - pool together many mid-level makers! **Enjoy the open process, play & community-building rather than fixating on unachievable impact!)**
3. High impact art (11%) (Only produced by anyone with polymath and ethical hacking skill - but these skills could be obtained by a 7 year old, especially today.)
