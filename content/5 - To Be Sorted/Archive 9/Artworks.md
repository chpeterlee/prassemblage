###### "Art is the objectively irrefutable a priori principle that each entity of the universe has direct contact with the universe in infinitely varying relations.

###### From this principle, then, the only ethical action is to produce variant negentropic evolutionary complexifications of the universe. 

###### That is what then aims and drives its collective trajectory - including the destruction of destructive entropy, either intentionally by an entity, or simply through evolutionary pressures." Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

##### "The Likelihood of Inaccurate or Inapplicable Interpretation is So High for Any Given Domain of Thought or Problem Space Per Individual, That it is Necessary to Simply Automate Everything That Needs to Function Well, Reinforce Heuristics of Misinterpretation Via Simulators, and Then Simply Provide Safe Postwork Environments and Health Services" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

#### "Mathematical Proof That Complex Solutions Cannot Be Explained To Particular Humans As If They Were Not Afflicted by Dysrationalia, But The Concrete Just Rewards Can and Should Be Distributed to Them" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

Most humans have Dysrationalia; no need to try to explain things to them, but there is a need to give them a piece of the pie!




##### "The Actual Audience of an Artwork is a Hypothetical Perspective Which Constantly Evolves to Think From the Least Entropic Perspective at Any Given Time. It's Almost Impossible to Do So Accurately as a Living Organism, But it Does Not Mean We Shouldn't Try and Forgive and Embrace Each Other in Our Attempts!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2024
