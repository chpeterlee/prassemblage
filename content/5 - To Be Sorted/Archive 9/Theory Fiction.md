## "Majority Weird Realism: An Accurate View of Objective Reality is That the Statistical Majority of it is Weird", Weird Studies Group, 2024


# Daxxed - getting hit by some corporate dweeb.





### The places with the best vibes on Earth, ever:

#### 1. Retirement homes. 
Because old people are unapologetically batshit insane and give zero fucks about society.
#### 2. Kids' Birthday Parties
Because kids are also unapologetically batshit insane. And birthday parties are when they unleash full insanity.
#### 3. The Weirdest Dive Bars Ever
Because this is where unapologetically batshit insane adults hang out.

###### Yesterday, a Humanities professor told me if I wanted to actually discuss what defines a human, I need to talk to a philosopher, not the Humanities.

###### Makes sense! Humanities creates individual events and experiences, it is not a field equipped to produce collective knowledge and discourse. 

###### All the problems and solutions lie therein.

###### "Art Does Not Reduce Complexity, But it Focuses It. Bad Art Throws Everything and the Kitchen Sink at You All at Once or Hides Behind a Pristine One-Liner; Good Art Structures an Emergent Strand of DNA, Using a Small Set of Building Blocks to Articulate Infinite, Open-Ended Complexities. Art Does Not Have the Same Goals as Communication or Mysticism - But it Subsumes Elements of Both." Han Jerry Larry, 2024
