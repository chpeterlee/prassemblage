### "ZombieTeenInaccurateCene: An era defined by 7 constraints:
1. 50%+ of modern populations have trauma or mental illness; thus they shouldn't be participating in any political interaction assuming full health and non-traumatized cognitive and discursive capacities. 
2. Most individuals involved in political discussions are specialists with a maximum maturity level of a teenager. Hence, much of politics simply resembles secondary / high school squabbles.
3. Most Humanities discourses, such as economics, politics, ethics and culture, are so underdeveloped as fields that they start from a realm of pure transcendental abstraction without any type of falsification or statistical verification check against the planet's evolutionary dynamics. **With the state the Humanities fields are in right now, if one person claims that air is real and another person disagrees, this claim cannot even be settled.** 
4. Most individuals participating in these discourses are actually traumatized or suffering a mental illness, operating with impaired metacognition, thus actually medically incapable of apprehending and synthesizing new, complex, multi-perspectival paradigms.
5. Actually, the most high-impact action for these individuals, across political commitments, is to stop exacerbating their medical conditions through attempts to think and talk, and rather focus their waking lives on low-intensity routines to stabilize healthy diets, fitness and socio-cultural regional-scale processes in small groups. They should be delegating all high-complexity and outcome-critical tasks to their sleeping selves, which can deploy their dreams as high-dimensional quantum chemical simulators. Any discussion of facts should be checked with AI, not other traumatized individuals.
6. If they want, they can use art purely as a sandbox, and open-ended simulation space and palliative care for conflicts and traumas they are interested in, as long as they are constantly maintaining the non-committal, autodidactic and non-fixated nature of the process. If they can't manage this, they are sent to even lower-intensity activities and environments with even less stimuli.
7. With such individuals, any intentional cultural production should be calibrated for a teenage mentality and confined to jokes, pranks, parties, story-telling, music, games and meditation. Anything that is a novel paradigm shift should be framed in terms of an encrypted reality game. " Chongha Peter Lee, 2024

##### Zombie Realism: The reality is that modern knowledge production and interpretation is so inaccurate, slow and incompetent that any discussion that has anything to do with actual reality is infected by undead zombideas that pretty much make any serious attempts at both knowledge production and rational discussion pointless, 9 times out of 10.
