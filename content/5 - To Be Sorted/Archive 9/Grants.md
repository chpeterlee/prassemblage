#### THE LAST POSSIBLE TECHNOLOGY: TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT TECHNOLOGISTS, AND THE LAST ART OF POSSIBILITIES

Perhaps there is nothing to being an artist other than continuously illustrating that there is nothing to be.

That is not to misconstrue this into an existentialist nihilism; the universe is unstoppable evolving towards more complex forms of life, with or without any of us.

No, what art simply posits is that there is no process that is not subject to re-configuration; hence all is simply just thrifting various outfits for the self-evolving universe. 

**By neither functioning nor dysfunctioning, the artist then portrays all that could and will be; the Last Possible Artwork.**
