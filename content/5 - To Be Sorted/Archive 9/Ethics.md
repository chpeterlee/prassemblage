You will walk away poorer, exhausted and angrier at the entire world. They will also probably face another catastrophe, which may be the one that kills them, making all your efforts meaningless. There is zero return on investment.
###### So why do it? Because it buys you time outside of a corporation or institution, so you can hone your skills and better map your targets. You have one life in this game; make it count." Joseph Bboys, 2024








#### "Next: Phase 3 - Eat the Rich or Die Trying (excerpt from Joseph Bboys' Peace Game Guide)

1. Ground in the insane boomers.
2. Build on the anti-establishment Gen X; connect them with anti-establishment Zillenials.
##### 3. **Roll call the few independent, skilled, bored and ethical Zillenials to simply kick ass and steamroll the 1%. All out f--king war, no mercy." Joseph Bboys, 2024

## Next:

Solution to the middle tier: focus on worst possible crises first. 

Any conceptual complexity beyond the idea of death and collapse is inconceivable; actual complexification will not emerge for 60 years.





Accurate models of real world systems are in such short supply that upwards of 50% of medical diagnoses are inaccurate and have to be revised **by a competent minority.**

If you look closely into any field, including art, you will quickly see that 72% of the field is intern level mistakes, 17% are able to pass a certification, **and only 11% are actually thinking and evolving the field.**

All real world systems are held together **by a competent minority.**




###### üêà‚Äç‚¨õÔ∏è Dr. Catpatia Piper: 89%+ of the field of art at this time is incapable of 21st Century critical interpretation, impact and infrastructuring. So what is its most bang for buck right now? 

1 - affirming the **SUPERPOWER** of questioning everything all the time.
2 - affirming the fact that Earth's history is simply a series of self-organizing, open-ended paradigm shifts. 
3 - affirming that any entity of the universe objectively has the universal option to self-teach to ethically actualize any option over time - ***but most will likely not do so, and that's fine, they can change their mind at any time, like a fickle cat üò∫.***

## The correct evolutionary trajectory for culture (aka lower the social floor and raise the roof)

##### 1. Make all life-sustaining functions and culture more and more accessible, almost to the degree someone in a coma could access everything via EEG.

## ***2. Make art less and less stupid.***

###### "Is it not accurate that ideas and culture should become more combinatorially complex over time, just as language or biology adds more combinatorials over time? Why settle for such utterly dehumanizing mediocrity in the artistic realm? Is it not accurate that society should be BOTH decreasing in barriers to accessibility while increasing in experiential complexity? Making shitty art in the name of accessibility is the exact opposite of the ethos of accessibility; stop insulting the intelligence of the differently abled." Garth Proxy, 2024
