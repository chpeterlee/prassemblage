# THE 0TH WORLD CHILL SWITCH, AKA THE INDEFINITE SINGULARITY

###### Finalizing The Postworkverse, Church of Just Pricing and the Triple Point Manifesto: 

The main game engine of the Postworkverse will be a simple paper toy cube, called **The Middle Play** or **The 0th World Chill Switch** or **THE INDEFINITE SINGULARITY**. There will be 3 main sections:

1. It will feature 10 Universal Negative Commandments comprised of what are the limits of possible thinking and action as a planet in 2024 to prevent climate collapse and technologically accelerated regional inequities. It will argue that our institutions are close to 60+ years from being able to safely stop these catastrophes. Perhaps by demons or aliens OR BOTH. 
2. After an accurate assessment of the widespread Dysrationalia mental illness amongst the majority of our populations, **It will endorse automated Postwork proxy politics, a feminist Septrivium curriculum, and gamification of incentives for behavioral change as the only options, with all funding framed in terms of insurance payouts by the 1% for drunk driving society to hit-and-run the world for 500 years of colonialism and imperialism. THUS BEGINS THE BANANA REVOLUTION AND POSTWORK INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. ****
3. Included with the toy will be a fun minigame where Peter, in song, game, film and painted form, bets his soul to the devil that this model can save the planet, everyone is welcome to ruin his plan or help him at **Ideapplebees**, depending on whatever mood they are in from whatever meal they most recently ate, phase shifting at will, like a material at its Triple Point threshhold, in a state of liquid, solid and gas simultaneously. **OR LIKE THE ROSETTA STONE 3-Way Social Contract!**
