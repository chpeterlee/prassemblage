Hence, any actual solutions have to account for the majority of human culture biased towards inaccuracy, adolescence and chemical imbalance.

Attempts to upgrade the planet's infrastructure should still continue, but it should be assumed it will be slow.

Stabilized Level 2: No activity, interaction or future. Open Doors Not Taken. All Virtual Doc fakes.

Level 3: Leave forever!

For the üê¢ middle class:
1. Proxy, unconscious accurate interventions; ZERO conscious uptake.
2. Peer diagnoses and interconnection via sandbox, open-ended art exhibitions; midterm pace.
3. One-shot healing games; slow uptake via daily consistency.

For üêá Peter:
1. Music
2. Games
3. Robots and Pranks

## Partial Views and Superpositional Sandbox Protocol

1. Explain it yourself.
2. If not explicitly labelled for impact, don't assume so.
3. Artists are free to multi cast and distribute and contextualize their own works.
