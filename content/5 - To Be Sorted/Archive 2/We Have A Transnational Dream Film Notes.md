1. 1980s Korea film - uncle and aunt on bridge during coup detat.
2. Background story: Under the Skin in the game. Aliens, angels and neganthropic models of energy vs. Zombinaries, demons and entropic models of energy.
3. Puzzles as assemblages, energy as driven by strange attractors. HADOUKEN. Autonomous nervous systems as being most of thought. Semiotechnical viruses disrupting it.
4. Abstract war out to info. Capacities and constraints and likelihoods.
5. Prevent immanent clikelihood.
6. Bosnian movie:
7. Answer postwork economy of peace, arbitration and simulation.
8. Good vibes, healightenment and thought.
9. Captain Amasia and Dr. Mousehelm. Dancing healer, anarchist farmer robin hood. - manassas, capoeira and heart surgeon. Knife and sword made of an assemblage of proofs. And shield of concepts. 
10. Giant Ronald Reagan and Thatcher and Chun Doo Hwan dead body made of data co-ops. Apologies.


What is organizing vibes and energy, whether good or bad, entropic or negentropic?

STRANGE ATTRACTORS.








#### Upcoming
The Postwork Industrial Revolution and 5 Year Peace Plan by:
1. Vulnerable populations and communities of resistance
2. Immigrant populations
3. Elderly, traumatized and exiled

In the Decolonies of Amasia, building the postwork economy of peacemaking, healing and empowering and ushering in the Amasian Renaissance.
**POSTWORKSTOCK OR BUST! MAKE AMASIA GAME AGAINST ENTROPY!**





##### In the Escape From Entropy Peace Game, a short, direct pipeline of the 11% top skilled individuals free of institutions, corporations and criminals are formed for direct, immediate action into crisis zones. Jokingly, they are called Section 11.





Notes:

Inequity produces crime; crime drives down business; so does poor mental health.

80% of the world uses art as substitute mental health, education and careers in regions with decrepit infrastructure, education and culture.

Why not just clarify this and appropriate 2nd World art and culture communities as an ecology of civic contractors providing effective regional engagement, development and health services?

And then fund them!

Crime
Suicides
Poor education and culture and tech


- art and crypto as tax breaks + ads.
- people buy into list + get ESTA certified.
- impact based data co-op - regioncoin - goes up!

----

- Prayer and music of all and dance
- Open the portal of judgements from aliens, angels and good energy AI models.
- summon the neganthropocene , autodidactic adjacent possibility and the generic
- exercise neoliberalism, the wrong side of history and  entropic energy

##### Upcoming: "Peter aka Captain Amasia, aka Estamasia's Puppet, Runs for President for the Republicans and Independent Conservative Parties Everywhere To Intentionally Sabotage and Disorganize Them" 2023









Why not run multiple fake conservative candidates to fragment and disorganize the Right?














# Time for the Healightenment Cult!





The Santa Claus model of social change (magically and invisibly making everything suck less)

1. Basically have one designated dude that is a wizard.
2. Create a morality of naughty and nice.
3. Give out bribes and lumps of coal.












Music, drugs and dance requiring zero learning!

Totally in party mode from henceforth!

Anyone who is deskilled and sad, I have friends for you to talk to!









By design of nature, most humans are astonishingly bad at reason; clearly they are designed to spend most of their time high as shit.

----
1. Everyone is 13
2. So much work arbitrating to just keep them alive - qqjust hire them as civic contractors or pay them via artworks.
3. Use basic design research / dev tools to survive in postwork economy.

Upcoming game mechanics sketch:

1. Only the top 11% skilled individuals of the planet will be able to do the minimum amount needed to avert planetary ecosocial collapse.

2. Everyone else should be assumed to be about 13 years old, and focus on creating minimum stable life conditions to NOT be incentivized into suicide, NOT be a burden on others who's time is better allocated to preventing collapse and NOT be contributing to collapse.

Culture should be retuned to ENCOURAGE people to help others stay alive and achieve these same minimum goals while the skilled people do the minimum to avert crises (because even for the skilled, it's enormously intense, complex and risky work and they'd ALSO rather just be on vacation, like you!)

3. There are minimal skills and equipment to do this, it can be learned in like a week and done with a 10 year old laptop!

Phase 1: Stabilize the most vulnerable - Done.

Phase 2: Make money and visibility - In progress.

Phase 3: Save planet with most skilled 11% - seeding now.







**Free Healgasm by Chongha Peter Lee - Explaining the 90's to Gen X:**

Why was the 90's culture so obsessed with specialization and difference? Because in the 80's in many countries, heavy manufacturing industries were gearing up, which required a homogenous culture. Hence, in the 90's service economy, which is primarily informational, the emphasis was on differentiating services. HENCE, the cultural emphasis on difference was simply riding the paradigm shift from the heavy industry economy to a service economy.

President Estamasia's platform:

Why Not End Neoliberal Capitalism Once and For All (Because Everyone Who Started it is Already Dead) and Price Everything Accurately According to the Present State of the Planet, the Physical Costs and The Evolutionary Trajectory of the Planet?

The Future Dead Friends Club Mission:

1. **Peace whore out Chongha Peter Lee for pay-what-you-vibe Healightenment mindsex work, who reportedly has incorruptible ethics** and puts art above life while verifiably saving others' lives. Funds will go towards scholarships and aid for vulnerable individuals. He also does not engage in improper relations.
2. He will attempt to reach Melania Trump, who he simply wants to have a coffee with while taking a pleasant walk through a nearby forest or lake, and explain a thesis about the politics of the right side of history, which are anti-neoliberal capitalism, pro-postwork and just pricing.
3. In the midst of this mission, any lonely people encountered will be redirected to Heal Team 6, a team of verified loving and kind gentlemen, for authentic love, care and humanization.





### "Impact-based Left", Elan Eagle, 2023
If you can't make a positive impact safely, stick with what you can, and research what you can't. Don't go 70's-90's bullshitting in, you'll get people killed, and then everyone is going to cancel you, then some insanely overworked angel, alien or polymath artist will have to keep you from dying and/or killing yourself while telling you how stupid you are. **There is no worse fate in existence than Elan Eagle keeping you alive while accurately proving why you are wrong.**

##### I am all for cosmopolitical, social and financial equality for everyone - but 100% there is no way in Hell that I will ever endorse poor quality conceptual art, other than as a learning exercise for an individual. In an age of planetary media, do I have to suffer through mediocre thought? No.
