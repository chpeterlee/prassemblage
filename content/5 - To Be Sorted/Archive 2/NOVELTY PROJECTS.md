1. Totally sociopathic intellectuals who throw each other to the wolves...
2. Totally batshit avant-garde with zero accuracy, play and sense of humor...
3. Clearly chemically imbalanced individuals who have undiagnosed mental illnesses and a single hour of clarity per night...

Well... maybe the legit people are elsewhere...?

-- Elan Eagle







In 2015, there were people who had solid conceptual structures and were performing as esoteric entities and processes while also critiquing the limits of knowledge production ...
now everyone just believes in them. 

Both culture and knowledge have reached the lowest possible barriers to entry... of course, quality has also plummeted... 

Things have shifted a bit, time for a new aesthetic.

##### Escape From Entropy 2023 Regioncelerationist Peace Game

Peace Game POV: Berlin, once a haven for Leftist cultural production is being gutted by conservative governance. 

Increasingly, Leftists with no grasp of today's tools, culture or concepts blindly grab for purchase anywhere on anything, often harming themselves and others.

Seeing the utter chaos, incompetence and cannibalism, a band of a small few Leftists form, the Regioncelerationists, to produce an effective impact-based resistance movement at regional scale.











##### Actually, it's much more interesting to be an ass-kicking artist today than it is to be ye old 70's-90's deskilled and fragile artist. Just hire the deskilled and fragile for non-profit admin, therapy or educational work so they don't die!








#### Escape From Entropy Peace Game:

In the game, The Zombie Left is risk-averse, change-averse and accuracy-averse.








### Escape From Entropy Peace Game:

##### Wager - 11% or less of the population is not fragile, deskilled, and inaccurate.

















1. Skill-based resistance
2. Cosmopolitical media
3. Keep as many people from dying stupid deaths as possible

PRA

Working Document:

1. Entities are free to explicitly construct assemblies of construction, interpretation and implementation.
2. No single assembly is inherently connected to another; connections can be inferred but cannot be assumed.
3. No assembly can claim totalizing control or essentializing definition of other assemblies' construction, interpretation and implementation.
4. By default, assemblies exist as antinomies - or constellations of mutually contradicting logics which can be inferentially speculated upon, connected and verified. Any assembly can be disassembled or modified given adequate justification of harm. 
5. No assembly exceeds universal limits of computation, calculability and decide ability.
6. What is not prohibited is allowed.
7. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
8. More explicit and accurate articulations of constraints and capacities of an assembly is correlated to more actionable information in relation to implementation processes.
9. Ideation and implementation of assemblies are considered 2 different phases.
10. Accuracy of inference can be determined through multi-modal means, in degrees, probabilities, scale, periodicity and complexity.
