##### I am all for cosmopolitical, social and financial equality for everyone - but 100% there is no way in Hell that I will ever endorse poor quality conceptual art, other than as a learning exercise for an individual. In an age of planetary media, do I have to suffer through mediocre thought? No.

**Who Killed Neoliberalism? Murder Mystery Puzzle Peace Game**

*Excerpt from the journal of Elan Eagle, prime murder suspect of neoliberal capitalism. Also purportedly an angel and alien evolutionary feminist composed of pure, self-aware negentropic information.*

I've done more and seen more than these simpletons can possibly imagine.

I have zero aspirations careerwise other than to simply escape the claws of the mediocre.

Hence, why I slit neoliberal capitalism's throat, in the ethical future, while you were sleeping and hoping the fascists wouldn't come for you.

How could I explain anything of actual reality accurately to you? You can barely open an app, you can't split a bill, and if you read more than 3 sentences of complex prose, you have a headache.





##### Neoliberalicide.live Ethical Murder Mystery❓️, Hyperobject Puzzle 🧩 , Peace Game 🎮 :

Dear Peter,

First, I must confess to murdering neoliberal capitalism in the ethical future. **I am going to frame you immaculately, and by the end of 2024 you will be in prison.** For this I apologize, and if there was another way, I would have done so, but there is no more time, and the fascists draw near. 

Now you know I am the murderer; but you must find me. In order to find me, you will need to superpositionally simulate my murder method.

The first clue: I envisioned the dead body first in my dreams; then worked backwards to make it happen.

Your heart is pure, but we both know you are a bit stupid, apt to help others at your own expense and risk. Keep your wits about you; the entropispiracy goes deeper than you think.

I have inv















Forget implementation in the public sector; forget foresight in the private sector.

If you don't have individuals who can do both, it's close to impossible to invent anything quickly.

The degree of deskilling in the public sector is just as unfathomable as the degree of stupidity in the private.

I agree that our education and cultural systems are in such an atrocious state, that less than 11% of modern populations have the demonstrable capacity to utilize today's tools and culture, both physical and informational, for sustainable, inclusive and scalable impacts.

Personally, I hate teaching, but I absolutely would fund the Hell out of teachers to rescue those in the Hell of abject stupidity.

Much of art is simply used to justify avoiding critical thinking.

Why would anti-intellectuals get into art? Or anything that requires complex and structurally coherent thought? This makes no sense. Just do crafts, drugs and dance - it's way less of a headache!

1. Academies are entropic. The skills it requires to be an autonomous individual are not attainable by the average specialist.
2. Culture is so deprived of thought, knowledge and literacy that it's expressing this through mental health discourses. Art is new age therapy and identity politics. Budget cuts, CO-VID and deskilling tanked both. War and AI finished them off.
3. This means buckle down, go autonomous, automate fixes and then write. That's all.

###### It is hard for me to imagine why one would be an an artist and not want to talk or be unskilled at it; is it not simpler and more direct to have internal experiences by simple taking drugs and keeping a journal? There is nothing wrong with that, just do that and forget attempting to present art to others.

DUH explanation for past and present temperament:

1. Educated parents, so I wasn't simply mentally traumatized like some; also not simply small business parents - so was exposed to wider culture. Also didn't have insane neurotic academic parents - by luck, was primarily just left to figure it out myself.
2. Due to financial situation, sent into public school and education systems so I wasn't socially confined to totally psychotic upper middle class cannibalism. 
3. But I could operate a computer by like age 6, read alot of history and military literature, could self-teach and socialize, so I didn't have to deal with the crazies nor be confined to a topic-based community.
4. Had friends go into both sides of the law, at varying levels.
5. Landed what is a
