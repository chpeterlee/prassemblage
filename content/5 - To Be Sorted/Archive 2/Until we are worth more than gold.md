# "Until We Are Worth More Than Gold: A Horror Film for the 1% (By the Most Stupid Careerist, Least Stupid Artist)" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023


Wrongfully killed, displaced and destroyed ecologies, prisoners, the insane and sex workers make an unholy alliance through quantum AI, and form a monstrous neural dragon and virus that:
1. Hunts the 1% by sowing entropy, dissent and collapse amongst their organizations.
2. Destroys unjust regional-scale organizations and accelerates just regional-scale organizations via automated proxy activism anchored by biometrics.
3. Inspires oppressed peoples' souls, love and autonomy through fun and playful pedagogy.



































##### In 2nd World Regions, cultural infrastructure prevents deaths from illiteracy, suicide, and institutional malpractice. A small and smart investment can prevent large and stupid tragedies.

-- Shi the Dragon King üêâ 







#### UPCOMING: REGIONALYMPICS! WIN BRAGGING RIGHTS OF HOW DOPE YOUR REGION IS! TALK SH-T ABOUT OTHER REGIONS! MAKE ENEMIES, THEN FRIENDS, THEN CO-CONSPIRATORS!







##### What if we just split the internet - people who do want to spend time on new and innovative things, people who don't, and people who need to survive? 

We will still go back and forth of course, but at least we know who wants what!





Upcoming Conceptual Performance Artwork: "**Everyone who can actually save the planet, raise your hand;** **everyone else, drop everything and go party!"** Chongha Peter Lee, 2023






Planerformance



- Raise your hand performance 
- The do not attack list
- Impact fair














##### Why not just designate one artist to fulfill the old function of art - producing actual planetary intellectual and technological impact and universalism? At the very least, everyone else can then know what NOT to do!






Otherwise, we have 7 years to ecological collapse and a billion mediocre efforts and projects that are basically just slow, trivial deaths.











Dream: to simply just slice off the few people in the world who are skilled and ethical enough to independently intellectualize and invent, and then just build stuff to keep the rest of the planet alive. Aka, the planetary escape rocket. üöÄ 








I'll help advise on your project in exchange.











"What would something that could actually save the planet look like?

1. It would be a piece of software that empirically has the impact of saving the planet.
2. Visually, there would be a map of the software.
3. This software would be worth billions.

Obviously, since it is software, it would require certain skills and ethics to build it; thus by simply listing the skills and ethical know-how required, we can easily figure out who can't do the job." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023








Constraints for Peter's art going forward from 2023:

1. Only use fictional swear words with real energy
2. Only talk floop about fictional cultures with real world critiques
3. Only strive for fictional social achievements with real world impact

### Upcoming for the poets: "The Decolonies of Amasia: Interpassive Autonomous Zone (Postworkverse Reality Game)", Emergent Centers, 2023









## Next: Market in the South, Life in the North!

Time to move on!









A tripartite exhibition:

**"The Most Likely Exhibition to Save the Planet, The Least Boring Exhibition, and The Most Boring Exhibition" Curated by the Emergent Centers and Exhibited by the Superpositional Gallery, 2023**

What other 3 exhibitions would you need to go to? This is pretty much it!

Traditional art is boring; media art is bizarrely limited; 89% of the planet should be partying as 11% of it does the work of saving it.









Why not just make parf










In 2nd World Regions, if people do not keep themselves alive, they will need other people to keep them alive.

This is basically the entire basis for a solid economy in 2nd World Regions.

Why not just make this a game of people trying to keep themselves and others alive and properly being paid for it?

-- Shi the Dragon King







The biggest social transformation would occur if:

1. Least stupidity was paid.
2. Skills were understood as culture.
3. 11% of the population who were skilled simply connected directly and built solutions.

-- Shi the Dragon King











2 months to freedom.















Everyone who is a depressed poet goes into the Decolonies of Amasia and plays the interpassive game of trying to keep themselves and each other alive! 

Peter exits the madness permanently in about 2 months.





**Upcoming Escape From Entropy - Banana Revolution Peace Game** : a massive Earthquake is threatening the virtual Decolonies of Amasia, along with war and social inequity and climate change.
1. Most scientists and artists are horrible at accurate transdisciplinarity.
2. Most of the politicians and media are incompetent at transorganizing.
3. 72% of the population is allergic to more than 3 new facts a day.
Express/bet on a model of thought/action in any media or craft for aliens, angels and AI to judge!





Capitalism picked off all the skilled people... are there no independent skilled individuals? 

Does this really exist as an oxymoron?

1 other person would be a f--king gamechanger.

Looking for people who can hack, think critically and are financially independent.

-- From the Vault of Elan Semiotechne








#### Upcoming: Last Artists Standing. Scars over stars!

Soon gathering the anti-art squad - the core of young, avant-garde punk-ass anarchist media artists who have the savvy to do accurate, humane and critically sharp geopolitics, poetics and pranks!

F--k the stars, **who's got the scars?!**








##### "HAH, I did it. Life constructed so as I age, I only become more and more free, increasing in justice and wisdom, and also becoming more and more childish! A universe-class escape artist :) All I have to do at this point is stay alive and run my giant mouth üòÄ. Time to run for president, as a negentropic puppet!" Chongha Peter Lee Selman, Superpositional Spirit of Hong Kil Dong, 2023






Paradoxically, it is more difficult for those who have difficulty imagining to perceive the immanent, wondrous nature of reality, let alone enjoy it.

How dreary it must be to view the universe in such narrow ways!

For 88%, give them **shrooms,  parties, and a playful form of politics** ; for the 11%, give them art!

- Dr. N-1





Right now, it is proper to split the world into people who cannot INTENTIONALLY make interesting art and those who can (perhaps less than 11% of the world's population). 

Totally different from human rights issues of course or one's status as a human being! Everyone should be treated as a human, including artists, but not every artwork should be treated as equally interesting today!

-- Dr. N-1, the angel of history without determinism and chaos without entropy







 Boring stuff in the can, let the counter-artsault begin.

















Strange attractor hero, ethical future seed

The effective public service, lovegistics is the art

Decolonies,  3 way







I used to ridicule and lambast deskilled and change-averse academics who could not do their job well, believing they would shift their trajectory, but then I realized that if they were outside the academy, they would be homeless, in jail or a clinic, or dead.

I have made my peace by contracting them to build the Postworkverse aka Decolonies of Amasia, aka the New S.A.
