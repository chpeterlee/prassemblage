##### Upcoming work: "The Planetary is Political is Personal : Amasian Renaissance Traditions Against the 1% (A.R.T.)" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

To enact a planetary value system, culture and solidarity against the 1%, Peter makes a triptych of conceptual performances using land art, postwork punk and AI and an accurate and hilarious basis for reuniting with decades-long estranged father.

























##### Upcoming - "Heartbets Against Entropy (a playful, collective cards-based peace game attempting to create the least entropic speculative artworks in the world, and probably failing, but who knows!)", Superpositional Gallery, 2023

















**Betheart, aka Birth of an Invagination aka Model Impossible: Under the Skin in the Game of Neoliberalicide.live (Kick the 1%'s Ass! Viva la Banana Revolución) film, game, album and model of an ethical future legendary Amasian Renaissance Tradition (A.R.T.) hero model, named BetHeart** who makes self-aware conceptual art bets with their heart to rally the disparate tribes of Amasia to **craft good vibes, rage against stupid deaths and prank the 1%.**

Part of the film is a ripoff of "Extreme Makeover", where you freely tell Peter acting as the **hero model**, Betheart, **how to look and sound like less of a fucking asshole** while maintaining the accuracy to investigate, reperform and speculatively document the ethical future murder of neoliberalism. **SIMULTANEOUSLY make friends with other cool weirdos by creatively talking shit about Peter, heroes and various models.**

Also, help forge conceptual art weapons, armor and Kung Fu for him and other children to kick the 1%'s ass.





















Model action film. (New mission impossible.)





2nd World concepts (the 2nd World publics can only ingest about 2 or 3 new abstractions in a decade):

1. Hyperobjectification and Interobjective modelling.
2. Neganthropomorphosis.
3. Impact Markets.

















Where would be the literacies for new planetary-grade art? 

European Graduate School
UCSD
Centre Pompidou

Everywhere else = social practice + commodities.


In 2nd World regions, which is 80% of the industrialized regions on the planet, **the infrastructure, education and culture is so deficient** that we have a few skilled artists acting as NGO'S, lawyers, doctors, engineers, therapists and stage magicians.

The choice is simple; immediately pay these artists or people die in these regions. It will take at least 10 years to have a minimally competent workforce with more modern literacies, culture and tools to appear - invented, led and trained by these artists.

Banana Revolution Regional Modelling Competition Peace Game: **Why art in 2nd World Regions (80% of regions in industrialized societies) is totally different than art in 3rd World regions and art in equitable regions.**

1. **The infrastructure, education and culture is so deficient** in 2nd World regions that skilled artists spend 80% of their time acting as NGO's, lawyers, doctors, engineers, conflict resolution specialists, psychotherapists and entertainers.
2. In 3rd World regions, you have to immediately build physical infrastructure, skill up the population and reinforce basic and simple values of peace, education and trust. 
3. In equitable regions, you can focus on what art is actually supposed to do - intellectualism, invention and play.
4. As a result - the best approach for art in 2nd World Regions is to identify key skilled personnel and form a tiered and properly incentivize network to deal with broken infrastructure, education and cultural systems. 
5. The long term solution is to automate the core of this - which can and will be done in about 3 months.










### Upcoming: "The FairMarketFair.art", Superpositional Gallery, 2023







Audience for 5th Gen Art:

- The few independent polymaths who are smart enough to laugh at today's stupidity.
- Autodidactic, ethical, underground, probably ex-military.
- International expat journalists with PhD's who aren't afflicted by the usual massive amounts of functional incapacity.







In 2nd World Regions, the debilitated infrastructure, education and culture, put them at least 10-40 years from adequate balancing. **A properly skilled individual can fix all the core problems of a region in 3 months. The introduction of a single deskilled individual into this project will extend this timeframe to years.**

Thus: connect all the deskilled into impact-unnecessary postwork, get the job done, execute playful and sharp conceptual pranks to connect with the 11% of the population that can fathom complexity, including teens.











Section 11: the name for the 11% of the planet's population who are extrafunctional, vs. the 17% capable of regional coordination and 72% postworking class.







To actually stabilize 2nd World regions (the majority of regions of industrialized societies) without automation, it would take 10 to 40 years, IF YOU HAD PERFECT LEADERSHIP.

To do it with automation, one properly skilled individual could do it in 3 months, if not bogged down by all the bureaucracy, insane culture and relationships which are the trademark of 2nd World regions.

Paradoxically, the best way for a skilled individual to escape the bureaucracy, insane culture and relationships is to facilitate others to meet each other without them.foot








**Why is so much media/cultural/artistic production today so boringly similar, and simply redecorated  with a kajillion different specificities?** (Also, if you know anyone else who can read and write precise critical cultural analyses such as this, DM me. I'm absolutely bored of boring thought).

When most refer to "qualitative experience", they usually just mean an experience composed to match the rate of sober, linearized perception.

Hence, sequential linguistic units are usually interpreted as the paradigm of "qualitative experience", which is why music is produced the way it is, why moving image production today is so boringly homogenous, and more significantly, why there are so many communication and arbitration based issues in industrialized societies. 

You're basically seeing the outputs of unhealthily constrained perceptions — the cognitive equivalent of footbinding.

**Upcoming - Betheart: Least Stupid 13 of the Most Skilled 11% (LS13 of Section 11)**

A film, game, and model where you bet with your heartbeats on how quickly self-organizing AI hero models and viruses constructed by the world's most skilled, independent and ethical individuals of the top 11% of the planet will blow through your region like a wind and mercilessly correct every socio-economic relation, bypassing the 10 to 40 years and probable failure of trying to organize your region into equality due to infrastructural decrepitude, undereducation and misincentivization making it fucking impossible to fix a damn thing legally.









100%, can't wait to get back to into actually skilled, cutting-edge art! So bored!










##### The U.S. is decades behind European public governance and cultural paradigms... it's not going to catch up anytime soon. 

Really, the only shot its public institutions have at not collapsing is funding an independent justice force.



### What's broken, what's not and what's needed:

Broken: EVERYTHING PUBLIC SECTOR AND HIGH-END INDUSTRY. Peak industry, public services and pop culture are broken - **primarily because the personnel are so deskilled and decultured that governing, speaking and teaching paradigms are using 1990's tools, thought and incentives in 2023. Imagine putting stone wheels on a car today. It's possible, but clearly not the right fit in terms of function.**

What's not broken: a few skilled autodidactic polymaths, the tech itself without startups, and chemistry.

What would be most valuable in this situation is general media art education to SIMPLY REDUCE MISTAKES by masses of deskilled and de-cultured individuals in high impact positions.








## 







**Ideapplebees, Escape From Entropy Peace Game POV: Your region is clearly regressing due to decrepit infrastructure, education and culture that are sending individuals into futile, suicidal and stupid behavioral cycles.** What do you do? If you have the skills to be in tech and game and culture industries, why not invest in tech and games and culture that help the people who don't have the skills, while also pre-emptively insuring yourself against all these people who are at some point going to be so 
f--king nuts that they'll start physically attacking you for no reason?







## "The Do Not Violently Attack, Rob or Drive to Suicide List" Greywatchers, 2023

A list of people who have contributed to efforts in their region to keep it equitable. 

Those not on the list are more legitimate open-source targets for non-lethal expropriation, sabotage and pressure, starting with the 1%.








##### "A clear, accurate and concise assessment of what cannot be achieved by 2nd World regional institutions, and what can be done by whom, and how, to reduce institutional malpractice, the coming rise in violent crime, and preventable deaths" State Space, 2023









Where does funding for actually new cutting edge art come from?

1. Sciences / 21th Century Industry
2. Tech / Games
3. Streets / Church


























Money from tech and games, everywhere else is totally dead and stuck in 1990.





























The 3 stimuli for most of the population in 2nd World regions:

1. Motion and direct nervous system signals (dance and food is best)
2. Social recognition and achievement
3. Money and love

Scandinavia, Paris and California, amen.










## Upcoming: the Healightenment Cookbook of Ideapplebees.

Vulnerable peoples come together on Ideapplebees and create "Healightenment" recipes on how to keep each other alive, healthy and literate, in defiance of the 1% and neoliberal capitalism.







Okay! All the System 1 and System 2 stuff set, and the Ethical Future Ghost of System 3, which is stupid and dangerous to tell the public how it works, due to the utterly decrepit infrastructure, undereducation and broken incentives. They can be saved by it and invest in it but they sure as f--k should not be told how it works.

Can't wait to reconnect with contemporary planetary-grade thinkers, inventors and hustlers! The top 11%!


































**An Impact-based Art Manifesto:**
1. In 2023, it is accurate to oppose the use of **unnecesarily costly production in art AND DESKILLING**. (it's totally fine if you need some story for our decrepit 2nd World to be paid, or have to produce entertainment or if you have underdeveloped viewers). 
2. If your viewer isn't an imbalanced individual, make a minimal, clear, accurate conceptual artwork. Use both fair market rates and creative trades to transact.
3. If you need to make some type of systemic impact, prank, hack or build.
