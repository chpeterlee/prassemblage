Notes on the Postworking Class by Elan Eagle:

1. It's 71% of the population **in light and heavy industry economies (Stage 1-2 Economies)**.
2. It is risk-averse, change-averse and imagination-averse.
3. There is a swathe of labor that they can perform - usually 1 shot transactions or passive interactions. Anything more complex is impossible.
4. Information can be transferred through **repetition of ritual** - Hence the long term economic solution is to create extremely basic, healthy regional service economies (**Stage 3 Economies**) distributing information that is not mission-critical, distributing healthy drugs, or simply reaffirming general principles of peaceful interpassivity.
5. The precedence for this interpassive approach to governance is Lao Tzu (not Confucius). The hard science supporting it can be derived from newer neuroscience studies which sketch out hard computational limits for most humans.










71% Postworking Class - music, games and fiction.

17% Specialists - existential media art club.

11% Skilled - Quantum, AI, XR and talk directly 












71% are children who need games that don't make them psychotic.

17% of adults need higher education via media art.

11% are skilled people who just need to connect to save the planet.







Why is your region insane?

1. Look at the education system. 70% of the children are expected to underperform.
2. Imagine what happens when these kids grow into adult bodies and then you let them loose.
3. They not only affect society outside institutions, but also inside institutions.
4. Couple that with ridiculous leftover ghost policies and predation from neoliberal capitalism ... perfect storm!









Games for kids, cinema club for adults, cult for best ideas!









Art would work if the individuals involved were educated enough to hold a complex dialogue; but they clearly are not... so it's totally useless for 89% of the population.

89% need something else!

**In the Decolonies of Amasia game, the public sector outperforms the private sector; not the other way around, as in the real world.**

In the real world, for a mixture of socio-economic reasons, the least skilled enter the public sector, which requires the most innovation, ethics and skill. Those in public sector now should just go into marketing, sales and project management.

This doesn't happen in the Decolonies; personnel are accurately allocated and compensated in a postwork economy.






### In the Decolonies of Amasia Game, the skilled private sector is objectively less skilled than the skilled public sector (which are almost as rare as unicorns.)



### In the Dwcolonie












## In the Decolonies of Amasia game.

Everyone is against the 1% and the top 100 corporations by default. There are 3 major distinctions of tribes:

1. The 71% Postworking Tribe, who are in either a chemically balanced or chemically imbalanced state.
2. The 17% Regional Organizer Tribes, who are either objectively wise or objectively unwise, on a case by case basis. (Wisdom being characterized by NOT engaging in behavior negatively impacting others. Negative self-impact is fine.)
3. The 11% Impact-based Tribes who are either producing entropic or negentropic impacts, on a case by case basis.











There's only 1 year to prevent Trump's re-election - this is pretty much all the U.S. Left should be focusing on right now.

You lose this now, you lose the planet for sure.







In the 2nd World, all of its problems are easily explained from the position of assuming the low distribution of cognitive and ethical tools for accurately discerning the complexity of today's systems, which can simply be called:

SemioTechnoMagick! ‚ú®Ô∏è 

-- Han Jerry Larry








Just as there is a difference of ethics between a civilian and combatant based on function; so is there a difference in ethics between chemically imbalanced and most skilled.

##### Is anyone else sick of the stupidity and lack of thought in relation to technology's impact on culture and ethics in Humanities? I know we are at least 40 years away from a competent academy, but for the love of God can we at least make failed attempts striving for least stupidity? Is not maximal stupidity as toxic as any other grievance on the Left laundry list?

**80% or more of artists have an 80% chance of making negative ecosocial impacts in the real world and simply require peer therapy and counseling; 20% or less have an 80% chance of making positive ecosocial impacts in the real world and simply require investment and marketing.**

If you are traumatized, go to therapy and connect with other traumatized; if you are antifragile, let's work.

In the Decolonies of Amasia peace game, an academic's work is broken into 5 categories:

1. Aid
2. Teaching
3. Administration
4. Research
5. Conflict Resolution Impact

-- Han Jerry Larry










The number 1 job of an academic is to simply negate stupid overextensions - let the present emerge on its own - that's all! All the impact of an academic is based on their negation of stupid future death and giving space for the present to emerge.

This also explains why they are so horrible at certain processes - like construction and improvisation. If most adopted this approach, the Earth would be in much better shape.

-- Han Jerry Larry







There are autodidacts that:

1. Produce net entropy per context
2. Produce net negentropy per context

Every negentropic autodidact should be constrained by ethics or they are basically just mentally ill! If they have no skills, then they have lower likelihoods of positive impact at higher complexity.

That's an easy way to simply differentiate!

-- Han Jerry Larry







Humanities academics and retro-thinking communities, from now until the next 40 years, are 3 things:
1. Risk averse
2. Change averse
3. Skill averse

Hence the only proper thing is to get fairly paid from saving their lives and communities when they inevitably face a catastrophe, playfully critique the negative impacts of incapacity, and enjoy waiting as the planet self-organizes into a less stupid state.

-- Han Jerry Larry













Clearly time for a dark comedy!




##### What most want and need from art is simply a space affirming civil cosmopolitical dialogue. Totally different than art for organizing, or art for impact! All 3 can coexist.

## WHAT ABOUT SUM BESTIDEAS.LOL CULT RAVES!

Oh God, can't wait to quit art and party forever! Pure hedonerdism.

Personally, I also detest the critical theorization of rave. There are stupid things that are good; that's a good enough paradox already. Leave it the fuck alone!

-- Han Jerry Larry










Famous and boring art - or insane and great art?

Definitely the latter.

What the Hell is the point of an art career if you have to work with boring people and make boring art ...? Easier to just get a day job! Way more fun to break things!

Oh Amasian Gods give me the strength to finish coding this system, make a ton of money and aid the people who are struggling, and then permanently move to cosmopolitan Europe, where intellectualism and culture are not treated like oil and water as in the U.S.

Even if we got all the people in corporations and non-profits to drop everything right now and prevent planetary collapse - the infrastructure, skills and culture would not be able to actually achieve this goal.

So, we need skilled and ethical outsiders who are not some insane, random 70s-90s paradigm children.

-- Han Jerry Larry





Phase Goals:

1. Stabilize 3-5 people from suicide and death.
2. Make community space with digital tools.
3. Make small, functional socio-economic pocket.

**Bad News, Good News:**

1. Everything the Left has been doing for the last 40 years is insufficient for systemic social equality; however it is great at providing life support for vulnerable individuals who'd die otherwise!
2. The Left, at majority scale, is technophobic, riskphobic and reasonphobic. 99% are deskilled, inaccurate and depressed.
3. Good News: there are a few who are skilled, accurate and antifragile, along with a few organizations which have high impacts.
4. The Right is less skilled, more resourced; in a new type of fight, they'd lose - IF the skilled, accurate and antragile were supported!
5. Everything can be fixed at regional scale, IF there is an accurate inventory of who can do what.

-- Han Jerry Larry













# If you are a regional scale organizer, why you need planetary-grade thought:

1. If you try to fight your regional scale organizations as another regional-scale organization, everyone is a teenager operating on 1960 paradigms and **they will more likely turn against you then solve collective problems.**
2. Planetary grade thought fixed all your region's problems like 10 years ago and **you never heard about it because your region is the same as most regions - anti-intellectual, technophobic and child-like.**
3. If you interface with planetary thought, **which is simply full of options, not commands,** then you can solve 80% of your region's problems through talking, partnerships and media. If you don't your region is going to regress and there's going to be dead people, crime and exploitation.
