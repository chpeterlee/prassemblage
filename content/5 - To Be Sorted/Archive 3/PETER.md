##### "All tormented artists and people, meet Ozan Atalan, the authentic affective artist you need and want to empathize with your pain and possibly Healighten it, unlike Peter! Selfish prick is only out to bet the devil and save the planet, that a--hole! Can't wait for him to lose, get sent to Hell, get slapped by some moms, and the world to end, because.", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023









##### "It is revealed that Ozan Atalan is a true artistic hero, ready to care authentically for your emotional needs, and Chongha Peter Lee is merely out to bet the devil, save the world and get slapped by your mom, a much lesser endeavor according to emotions." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

Amasian Biennale: end preventable death, reductionisms and unsustainable, uninclusive and unscalable modelling.

Fail towards utopia! Like a jellyfish Frankenstein, farting, burping and crying towards a huge psychedelic algae buffet.


















Model economy and postwork. Confidence man. Temples. Earthing, earthquakes and earth temples.
