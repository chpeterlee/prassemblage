Impact theory
Peter's bet.






Without general logic, math and physical perception, the planet is a prison, not paradise. And it takes 10x as much labor to keep someone without those skills alive.

It's impossible at this time to teach them. I don't give a fuck about emotions. All I want to do is keep them from dying stupid deaths. 

God, let me live long enough to build the AI to do that, I don't give a fuck about anything else.

The traumatized need AI, XR and mushrooms; not education and stimulation. Put them in a simulation so they don't die and/or burden others.

Zero-click solutions.












Mushrooms trigger an open-ended feedback loop in human brains... can this be done through other means?

People mangle language because there's very low structural literacy, which is why there's so many lurkers ... so then the trick is to use language to produce open feedback systems.

Old school conceptual and video art, then.











Teaching and projects only work on the sane; media play is best for the insane.



Social balance will happen over 60 years, gradually.

The most important thing to build is media games for the irrational, which is most.

Not to get "better" — throw out teaching and education — but simply to not die.
