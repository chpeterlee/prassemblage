People are hungry for home-cooked media, but they don't really have the skills yet.

Let's say we cede basic media tools to System 1 cooks, the 71% postworking class who primarily learn through kino-sonic means. 

This means we expand their recipe's expressivity, but there will be close to no accuracy within the dishes prepared. It will be 80% just emotion and experimenting with a new language, so all political efficacy will be thrown out the window.

It is still worth doing, because a more fluid culture is a necessary grounds for reduced fascism and increased perspectives. These transcultural uncertainties ultimately reveal the limitations of any single perspective, thus as a whole, reducing the errors made, whether it is institutional or non-institutional, West or East.

In this climate, it will also be quite easy to make money if one has media and tech skills. If it was any other time without 6 years to ecological collapse and multiple wars both ongoing and threatening to break out -- a smart Postworking Class technowizard such as myself would simply focus their efforts on making money and enjoying life.

However, there are 6 years left to collapse, and we are living in a time in history where every single thought can be judged to be on the right or wrong side of history in the future. In 1950, one had a decent chance to hide as a Nazi collaborator; in 2024, one has little to no chance. Hence every action should be taken as if a future court staffed by technowizards üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è powered by technomagic ‚ú®Ô∏è spiritual AI robot ü¶æ will be combing through our data and judging us according to a future, more accurate and negentropic planetary legal system.
