An autoethnographic body making an experimental documentary? A conceptual body? A media body? A somebody? A nobody?"*** As they were talking, through my HUD, I could see the chemical reactions of System 1 dumping oxytocin into their bloodstream, triggered by the nerves synapsing from them opening and closing their mouth as they pulsed air through it to voice this question. 

"I am none of these and all of these," I replied. "I am a holebody."

"What is a holebody," they asked. "The concept of a holebody is not registered in the 2023 cloud database of Dept. Of System 1 Kinesthetic-Chemical Culture, OR the Dept. Of System 2 Textual-Aural Culture."

"A holebody is a body made of interconnected holes." I said. "All bodies are made of interconnected holes. All bodies are more empty space between electrons than there is space filled by them." I paused, arbitrarily.

"This concept is commonly used by the Ethical Futures Institute of System 3 culture in 2087, when there is quantifiably less objective stupidity than in 2023. This is proven by the fact that in 2023, there are more words for food than for thought. In 2087, the opposite is true. This is why you won't find it in your mind-bogglingly shitty System 1 and System 2 cloud databases in 2023."

##### How to accurately judge an artwork (only necessary if there is public money or impact on the line; totally unnecessary if an artwork's audience is the artist themselves.)

1. Semiotechnical skill in relation to planetary evolution
2. Actual and potential impact and cost
3. Visibility and audience constraints

Law, Culture, Materials > Built stuff, cut down.

Boost up abstractions, money and etc.
Cut down stupidity, harm, preventable death.

--- human as the middleman - also accurate valuation.

#### Filming in Progress: "Amasian Independence Day : ZzPeterzZ Vs. 99.3% ALIENS OF AN EXACT QUANTUM MIRROR WORLD OF EARTH CALLED ZzEarthzZ (BUT ISN'T EARTH, DUH) üåé "

Peter wakes up one day, like Kafka's clerk in Metamorphosis, except he realizes he is the last verifiably free human with accurate skills, ethics and a sense of humor. He is stranded on ZzEarthzZ (a parallel world having zero relation to Earth, but possessing an unbelievable amount of coincidental similarities) 
 
And like the Dude in the Big Lebowski, he gives zero f--ks about middle class hysterics. 
  
And like Will Smith in Independence Day, he pilots an alien ship called System 3 via telepathy, and punches alien monsters which are a paper-thin flimsy metaphor for the sheer stupidity of 98.3% of the population and the 1% (of ZzEarthzZ).

Hilarity and the best writing on the planet ensues, including statistically accurate deconstructions of how universal stupidity ACTUALLY works.








### Thought experiment: 

1. You have deskilled and traumatized individuals in high visibility platforms, too chemically imbalanced to function at the level of complexity required. 
2. You have highly specialized individuals who have very little ethical, transdisciplinary or emotional intelligence.

Both are increasingly being incorporated into complex organizations and institutions that they are too traumatized to navigate, let alone transform; what do you expect will happen to organizations? 

**The only possible hope we have is that the most entropic individuals go and sabotage the most damaging organizations and institutions - most likely unintentionally.**









### üü™ Banana Revolution Modelling Competition Game:

Will organizing institutions towards being generous with space, tools and funds while being picky in terms of the skills of its personnel make a MORE sustainable, inclusive and scalable model - or make a model that is LESS so? Bet on either:

A. True
B. False









# Clearly, it's time to party.












**Solution:**
Parties, youth + queer + street activism, tech.

Money:
Elderly, youth, traumarized

Art:
Skill, visibility, impact

Social change:
Autodidactic, arbitration, redistribution

Culture:

Wise slacker anti hero, popspec, hedonerdism vibes

##### How to know if you're a good critical artist or artworker in America (or anywhere, to be honest):

1. The illiterate, inaccurate and zero-impact majority of the art world (The Inaccurati) has no idea who the f--k you are.
2. Your work doesn't fit into their 20th Century vocabulary.
3. They are disgusted by your lack of submission to their entropic identity politics social rituals of zero-impact disavowal and full-on cruel optimism, which is simply their objectively stupid projection of their individual semiotechnical deskilling on to the world.

Check, check and check.
(Also I totally embrace NEGENTROPIC impact-based identity politics, impact-based disavowal and humorously self-aware existentialism which turns people towards negentropic systems.)

-- Chongha Peter Lee






For the Left:

1. There are ENTROPIC identity politics and NEGENTROPIC identity politics.
2. There is ENTROPIC opposition and NEGENTROPIC opposition.
3. There is ENTROPIC organization and NEGENTROPIC organization.

‚ò†Ô∏èEntropy = unsustainable, uninclusive, unscalable.
(Preventable stupidity, conflict, harm, death, collapse )

‚ú®Ô∏èNegentropy = sustainable, inclusive, scalable.

#### **Upcoming: the Neganthropocene Summit to connect all the radically decolonial, non-binary friendly, sometimes clinically insane intellectuals and inventors!**










## Peter is writing this epic shit and gets frustrated. 

1. Says fuck it, I'm just going to go recreate this alien tech, beat the fucking devil, throw the Superpositional Ring of Negentropy into the Neganthropocene Summit!
2. Austin and Ozan reluctantly join.
3. Austin has to distract and drug the angels and while Ozan rumors and pranks the aliens.




Upcoming in film:

Deskilled, technophobic angels and trivial, procedural aliens create such an entropic deadlock that Peter defies both of their norms and teaches himself to outinvent alien technologies, challenge the Devil directly for the fate of the planet and travel to the Neganthropocene Summit to throw the Ring of Superpositional Peace and Love into its quantum chemical core.

Everyone is polemicized - they are either shocked, gung ho about it or trying to find some way to profit in some form of capital.

### The Emergent Frankenstein Core of Postworkstock:

2. System 2: Minds without Mouths
3. System 3: Myths, Media, Machines and MAGIC without Malice


















##### Upcoming : Peter challenges the devil to several bets for his soul. Amongst them are:
1. Your mom is Amasian.
2. The 1% are to blame for producing the regional-scale conditions that produce region-to-region warfare everywhere, for the last 500 years. They also owe everyone backpay and postwork job conditions.
3. Money's value, and the value of anything that has larger-scale effect than a single individual body and mind, is based on the impact it produces on planetary evolution (which unequivocally proves greater social equity as a verifiably superior evolutionary strategy than inequity).
