1. The human brain is biased towards System 1 - locomotive, unconscious and parasympathetic functions simply to keep the organs working and the body alive. There are numerous unconscious nervous system and chemical responses which produce what people call are "good vibes".  For most people, whatever triggers "good vibes" is the extent of reality.
2. It takes education to help a human body develop System 2 skills - abstracted logics beyond the line of sight. There is also an emerging theory of a "System 3" dealing with accurate statistical imagination, intellectualism and invention.
3. During CO-VID, human populations across ages were basically stunted in development - every demographic missed key processes that expanded their psychosocial and technical vocabulary. This is evident in students today.
4.  During the 1980's, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher issued budget cuts to social services and education, along with coercive military and financial policies that basically stunted the growth of entire regions. This is why educational and institutional staff is underpaid, underresourced and underskilled, and why we repeatedly see individuals with psychotic behaviors due to cognitive impairments in industries.
5. The future is easily projectable; either re-organize institutions and industries to provide missing services for traumatized populations and thrive in postwork economies - or fail to do so and collapse into conflict, stagnation and entropy.
