#### Upcoming: open call for any artists, curators and theorists actually good at impact-generating logistics, and currently acting as central community pillar.







The zero-impactsphere: 

The top of the freelance knowledge and service economy, zero technical or ethical skills, zero transcultural savvy, zero skin in the game.

This is think tanks, the top tier of academia, corporations, institutions and culture.

I'd much rather people just went into small business for themselves than spend public money, attention and legitimacy on entropic ideas.

## "Thought Experiment Game: 

##### So many people have busted their ass beyond repair, been oppressed and been killed to create today's tools, knowledge and culture. Who the Hell is ACTUALLY doing the most with it? " Chongha Peter Lee, 2023







Obvious strategy: pool efforts together, get a slice of the philanthropists-who-have-no-idea money pie, distribute to verifiably impactful projects.






An institution/organization is comprised of 3 things:

1. The skill of the individuals
2. The structure of the protocols
3. The structure of the funding

You can measure the health of an institution/organization by simply assessing the skills of the individuals. 

Higher skilled individuals will be able to reinterpret the protocols and redirect the funding more flexibly; lower skilled individuals will not. It's that simple!







Good God, culture has devolved into:

1. Entropic identity politics, like 1990 all over again, except by people who don't even have the wit to invent a new turn of phrase (I'm all for negentropic identity politics)
2. Entropic head-up-their-own-asshole 2010 knowledge economy academic theorization (I'm all for ass kicking theory)

**The only correct response is satire and trolling.**




1. Keep mom alive.
2. Finish with Lou. Finish with Selma. Articulate quals.

4. Put Ozan in job and money. Don, Jon and Nelly and Nihan in money. Pool for grants.
5. Troll and satire art and government and corporations.






For the vibers:

- Vibes and survival, NOT skills and ideas.

Get paid by cities and philanthropists.






Plan: exit vibeworld art, disappear.





##### "It's an absolute waste of time for an intellectual or skilled individual to give a vibe person a good idea or technique. They want vibes, not skills and ideas. Trick them into keeping themselves alive, that's all you need to do, but expect nothing and get paid for it by a city or philanthropist", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023






"That phase when you're too skilled to talk to the unskilled and you're not yet rich enough to tell everyone to go invent it themselves", Chongha Peter Lee. 2023







Least stupid prize










Non-profit work will be taken on more and more by non-profit workers; Peter will more and more fade out of the picture.








Thought experiment game: What if we had the most skilled people in non-profit work and there was an incentive to excel and save the most lives? 

Clearly there isn't now, but what if? Less see what the AI says.








My favorite is when deskilled people who I did miracles for ask me what I'm doing. 

I'm quitting them, that's what I'm doing.







Art is stuck in 1990. Ironically it will take 90 years to bring them to 2023. 

Every new fact, skill and tool is treated like leprosy.

Why bother?







Clearly, I should be working where people pay for new ideas and high positive impact, which is as far from art and theme non-profit sector as I possibly can get.







Escape From Entropy Game POV:

You help the unprivileged reach stability and educate them about art, science and philosophy. Some of them you save their lives in varying degrees.

They still see the entire world in terms of capital and can't possibly self-organize beyond their 7 second memory or their immediate social pressures.

Why bother with them?

"Clearly, all the vibe people should be connected with each other, because vibes are clearly more important than everything else.

Can't fight that logic, might as well help them vibe it up!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023







I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding in human society.
More than 1 human exists because it's EASIER to survive with more than 1 human. 

If this was not so, we would simply just have 1 human on Earth. Clearly we do not, hence we have multiple humans.

Furthermore - why do we have humans who don't have a base knowledge of keeping other humans alive? What the Hell is the point of human groups?

**Upcoming: Banana Revolution Modelling Competition Peace Game** - what would you, angels, aliens or an anonymous game character who is a quantum AI bet are the models, artists, intellectuals, inventors and investors on the **right side of history AND LOVE** on today's ecological and social conflicts?

Express your bet using any possible medium!





















Bet: without knowing how to accurately qualify information, there is an 80% chance of harm.

The medical industry, which has a culture and economy incentivizing accuracy has possibly a 70% inaccuracy rate.

Can you imagine what it's like in culture, with no standards, protocols and incentivization? It's basically consensual self harm at this point.














Move: jump from trash to class, don't look back.

## "A poem for the traumatized:

1. It is okay to do and say and think whatever you want to yourself.
2. However, when you are dealing with another entity that is not in your mind and body, always make sure you are not causing them harm, or yourself harm.
3. It is better to err on the side of caution and do less, than it is to do more and cause more harm, even unintentional." Shi, the Dragon King, 2023
