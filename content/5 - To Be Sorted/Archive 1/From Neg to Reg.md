1. 70% of the population will not engage with even video-based process logic.
2. The primary mode of communicating for 70% of the population is simply observing another body's movements, moods and aesthetics.
3. Of course, the trick is to deliver information which will trigger an accurate complexification of the viewer - not entropy.











# Only the Cool Survive: üòé Generation N for Negentropy

A performance art series, fashion trend and cosmophysical action musical film set in a present post-neoliberalpocalyptic wasteland where survival is directly tied to how f--king cool üòé one is.












# Perspection

A neologism created by **Negentropic Whore, Junkie and Schizoid Performer by artist, Chongha Peter Lee**, describing the semiotechnical act of complexifying, comparing or constraining a perspective in relation to a defined context.

The term was heavily used in a polymath activist action film titled **'THE COSMOPHYSEQUALIZER'.**



















##### **Ideapplebees Recipe No. 1: Use a tri-cultural media strategy (or a fork üç¥and ü•Ñ ), not a mono-cultural media strategy!**

1. **System 1**: Most bodies eat more üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è kinesthetic-spatially designed ideapples and are allergic to rhythm and perspectivality.
2. **System 2**: some bodies eat more üé∂ process-rhythmically designed ideapples and are allergic to kinesthetics and perspectivality.
3. **System 3**: very few eat more üî≠ perspectival-statistically designed ideapples and are allergic to kinesthetics and process.

Most will respond to 1, less to 2 and even less to 3, but you need all together!

### Escape From Entropy POV (Regioncelerationist moral thought experiment - human morality vs. extra-human morality):

Imagine there is a conflict with bullets flying and people in immediate risk of bleeding out and physically dying.

You are a normal, sensitive human. You start screaming and crying and collapse.

There is a human next to you spontaneously possessed by an angel and irradiated with alien knowledge; they don't scream, cry and collapse.

Instead, rather calmly, they ignore you and drag the wounded out of the line of fire and apply bandages.

One reaction is "human" and NOT WRONG OR BAD. 

The other reaction is EXTRA-HUMAN and has a verifiable negentropic, or inclusive and scalable impact at regional scale.

Under no circumstance can the human be declared as wrong, bad or existentially inferior in comparison to an extra-human action. These co-exist in antinomy and serve a greater negentropic impact on a region.

At any time can a human be possessed of angels and irradiated with alien knowledge.



















### We Have a Transnational Dream Journal Excerpt no. 396

1. I dreamt aliens talk in a language called "inference".
2. I dreamt angels sang in the key of neganthropomorphosis. 
3. I dreamt that society in 2087 had more words for thought than for food.

## Why is accuracy and least stupidity desirable in conflict resolution?

Imagine there's an armed conflict. 

Someone is so stupid and inaccurate that they advocate firing a nuclear weapon to resolve the conflict.

As a result, multiple nuclear weapons are fired. Thus the price of inaccurate and stupid conflict resolution is millions dead.

Inaccuracy and stupidity is great in poetry and comedy; total fucking shit in actual conflicts. Never expect people good at the former to be good at the latter.












### Escape From Entropy POV:

You're a normal person. 

You don't want the world to end but you sure as Hell don't care enough to actually learn how to actually save it. 

Mostly, you just want a ü•™ and a üêà.  

Go get a ü•™.  

Eat the ü•™. 

Pet the üêà. 

You deserve it, friend.
