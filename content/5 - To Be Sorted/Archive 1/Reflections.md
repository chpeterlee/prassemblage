## Proposition
 
We connect all the articulate conceptual artists and have them talk and think for everyone else to remix. 

(This is literally what military strategists do)













Why I bet against a widespread, sudden mass enlightenment or revolution:

1. Art is in 1900.
2. Academia is in 1980.
3. Culture and Industry is in 1990. 

Clearly, people can't and should not be asked to think or function... this leaves...

Dreams, games, subconscious deprogramming.












"There's only 3 intellectuals and inventors on Earth who can think accurately through its problems:

1. Manuel De Landa
2. Stuart Kaufmann
3. Reza Negarestani

Every other academic should be focusing on therapy, teaching or organizing at regional/multi-regional scale - worthy activities!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023













##### "System 3:

1. Manuel de Landa
2. Stuart Kaufmann
3. Reza Negarestani" 

Chongha Peter Lee, 2023











 "**System 3:** really, the only 3 individuals on Earth with a high likelihood of accurately framing, articulating and verifying the priority sections of today's ecoscial problems and solutions at planetary scale (plenty of people can't do it accurately but can raise awareness, which is necessary also):

1. Manuel De Landa
2. Stuart Kaufmann
3. Reza Negarestani

Everyone else can be engaged in open-ended media art and poetry exploring the issues and contributing partial components, but I highly doubt a fully synthesized, complex and accurate solution could be produced outside of these 3 within a decade ‚Äî **although I hope it happens and people are welcome to propose them!**", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023
















# "Unlock the massive negentropic energy stored in your cells!" 



### Some intellectuals and inventors are like the sun, empirically executing fusion processes; others are like scientists on Earth trying to discover it.










#### 3 people I'd trust at international scale thought:

1. Manuel De Landa
2. Stuart Kaufmann
3. Reza Negarestani

I can have particular claims error-checked by their students, without getting caught in their ongoing development.















## Split 3 scales of experience and knowledge for Humanities:

1. International (System 3)
2. Regional (System 2)
3. Daily (System 1)














###### Humanities and sciences academic institutions cannot function as novelty productive systems until their incentivization systems are fixed, their cultural protocols are more flexible and their self-evaluation metrics are more accurate. This will take about 40 years. Until then, there's only a small number of ways to utilize them.

1. DON'T ASK FOR IMPACT OR SYNTHESIS: For 40 years, no institutional academic is actually going to create a project that produces actually verifiable, inclusively scalable real world impact upon a large and complex problem (like say, regional-scale peace). They don't have the combination of skills, culture and technology.
2. ASK FOR ERROR-CHECKING AND HISTORICAL WISDOM: They do have a great archive of catastrophes that have happened.
3. AMAZING AT MORE COMPLEX INTEREPRETATIONS OF SIMPLER LOGICS: They are great with cultural, organizational and forensic criticism and interpretation! This is the best bang for buck.

















### Upcoming:
System 1: Cosmopolitical Peace Potlucks at Ideapplebees & Heartbets Hospital Against the Fallacy of Inaccurate Concreteness (AF Agency and the Postworkverse)

System 2: The Decolonies of Amasia WisdoMatrix of the Ethical Futures Institute and The Amasian Court of the Right Side of History (The Amasian Post & The Emergent Centers)

System 3: The Devil Came Down to Amasia & Dreamwalks Through The Garden of Neganthropic Delights (State Space & The PRA)

The Xenabloom. Metaphysequality.

Small business, error checking international scale war, peace between state and people.

Alien doctors and shamans. Lumacological Surgery and naming and containing of the bad spirits.













#### Ideapplebees Potluck - Some Question Buffet Appetizers!

![[Pasted image 20231018000225.png]]

1. What is the difference between HUMAN and HUMANE? (Totally open question!)
2. Why is it impossible to actually solve todays world's problems WITHOUT THE ARBITRARINESS OF ART AND A CULTURE THAT ISN'T TOTALIZING/ESSENTIALIZING? 
3. 1%, war and stupidity all traceable back to "THE FALLACY OF INACCURATE CONCRETENESS"?


















## In every system in today's world, at some point you have 3 things:

1. A human.
2. A machine.
3. The planet.

Without knowing how these 3 things work, it's very hard to design, organize and live.

**Script excerpt from the film - "World War 0: Birth of an Invagination and the War on Entropy"**, a Regioncelerationist Movie:

1. **Inaccurate System 1 (only accurate within line-of-sight) Characters, or 70% of modern populations** who cannot handle higher degrees of complexity without getting someone dumber, ruined, injured or killed are sent to play "Escape From Entropy", where they enter into a mutual aid network to improvise on how to balance themselves and their region.
2. A System 2 arena for characters or 29.3% of modern populations, who can accurately define, discuss and verify complex problems and solutions without getting someone dumber, ruined, injured or killed are put into specific tiers of art and circulation which screen out System 1 characters. They defer to System 3.
3. System 3, or. 7% of the population is defined as having the skills to actually resolve the world's ecosocial crises and resourced, incentivized and tasked accordingly.

Never mix the two!

##### "If an individual simply wants to be safe, why make art? Go work on being safe, that's more important. Also, if you can't handle yourself in high stakes situations, you will get others killed or ruined, and then from your fragility, you will probably commit suicide.  Go work on safety first. If you want to have fun doing it, gamify it!" @HanJerryLarry of Bestideas.lol, 2023.














##### Upcoming: final piece of the Democraseum in place (Regioncelerationism). Next, organizing both a succinct presentation and friendly and open idea potluck with academics, activists and artists across the planet.

By far, one of the most astonishing events of the last 3 years was talking with an Italian journalist who possessed a PhD and was capable of simply discussing conceptual art without me having to educate them.

In an instant, I would trade every artistic and street credit I have been attributed with ‚Äî for complex, friendly intellectualism. Alas, this is a prospect that is, no doubt, months away. Until then, I have my pipe üö¨, and my transnational dreams üí≠.

### Will soon be taking bets for when you think I will end up in jail!














### Who is Joseph BBoys, aka Artist Zero? Imagine an artist who is so self-aware that they themselves are a meme, and they can:

1. **Do Polymath-grade Analysis and Ethics:** Able to statistically prove anything from art, projects and investments to be on the right side of history or not.
2. **Ethically Hack and Playfully Educate** teenagers of any culture to do so.
3. **Make B-Movie, or Stranger Things style surreal, funny and not-too-vulgar culture** to communicate complex and sensitive ideas for a general public.












**Upcoming #Regioncelerationist artwork, film and game to play with your absolutely insane family, friends and kids: "@EscapeFromEntropy"**

POV: like me, you live in a region that has been rendered irreversibly stupid due to neoliberal capitalism. Nobody reads sh-t, even though a 7 year old today could self teach themselves to solve every possible problem. You have insane people from every possible culture and temperament randomly saying absolutely inaccurate and inane sh-t because they are hangry. How do you escape from entropy, and more importantly get the Hell away from your region?









##### I'm absolutely against nationalist and socio-economic borders in physical territories; all for conceptual and artistic borders to shield me from the unimaginative and mediocre.

After the planet is fixed, I'm building a a firewall for stupidity.

-- Chongha Peter Lee














**Upcoming Performance: "Take me to your thought leaders"**  

Peter dresses up as a polymath alien shaman, which he is, and demands to be taken to others of equal capacity to make artworks that verifiably evolve the planet and speak the unimaginable alien language known as Accuracy.

For everyone else, he has various mini-games for them to play.

In the model artwork, film and game, WorldWar0.cloud, one of the most amazing things of the Amasian Rebel Alliance's **Decolonies of Amasia** is that they have a **Complexity Observatory** (across the street from Ideapplebees), which is staffed by professionals who can accurately grade which paradigm shifts evolve the planet and which don't. 

Clearly, this is a metacommentary on the utter incapacity of the real world's systems to accurately compare paradigms of anything that isn't an edible object.









***"Polymath Artist, Will Travel"*** Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

After fixing regional infrastructures, just trying to get to a place where I can go to work every day and enjoy making planetary-scale, paradigm shifting art for a small audience lol. Is this so much to ask?

A very 2000's-era dream haha.

Man, can't wait to get back to making high-tier media art. Miss those complex conversations! 

Traditional art is all market crap and power relations, so boring. I'd rather just prank those people!
