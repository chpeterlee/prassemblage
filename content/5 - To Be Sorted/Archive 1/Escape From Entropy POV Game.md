#### YOUR CHARACTER BACKGROUND: 
1. You are a decent average schmoe, a good person, in the middle of the middle class. **Your strength is your **PURE HEART.**  Unfortunately it's also your weakness. You have deep, visceral feelings about today's complex systems, ideas and events **BUT you have extremely little actual accurate understanding about them or skills to actually solve the problems.**

2.  **Unlike the screenshot above,** in real life, you wouldn't actually risk picking up a gun and fighting and getting imprisoned, tortured or killed for a particular side, nor would you risk your job and health insurance, nor would you risk social ostracization and exile.  Nor would you actually do the work of actually learning all the complex theory and technical skills to actually solve any problems systemically. **AREN'T YOU DOING ENOUGH G-DD-MN WORK? YOU GOT BILLS TO PAY.**
    Basically, you have extremely low risk tolerance for actual consequences, threats to your social stability and sense of ideological comfort. **But by God, nobody can take OUR freedom to critically spectate and comment!**
#### F--K. WHAT THE F--K AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THEN?
3. Why not make a character and play Escape From Entropy? So you can irrationally playtest all your irrational actions to today's complex systems without getting someone killed and without someone hovering over you judging you? 
4. Not only do you reduce the risk of harm to yourself and others, **the irrationality, inaccuracy and risk of YOUR behavior will actually help train an AI model on what NOT to do, because it would actually hurt people in the real world.** 
5. Finally - Escape From Entropy fully endorses an absurd, inclusive surrealism which understands the cognitive, social and economic limitations of the middle class, lower, middle and upper, and cherrypicks the best of all three to make something **AWESOME.**
