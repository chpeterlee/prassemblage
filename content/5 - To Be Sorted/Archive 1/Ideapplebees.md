Posthumanism = Peace Vibes resonance
We can argue the principle Posthumanist action today in light of the totally devastated and undereducated society is resonating peace vibes - simply articulating the devastation done and risk endured.








Aliens resonate knowledge


Peace by example; practice and resonate peace is the goal. 

Interior to exterior via resonance. More effective.

## Ideaplebees commercial: Why Ideapplebees?

POV: you stumbled into contemporary art and some type of critical awareness, and you can't go back to mainstream culture **NOW THAT YOU KNOW**. 

However, Contemporary Art doesn't give you the skills to ACTUALLY solve the world's problems, nor are you going to go and teach yourself the skills. **Your main skill is deconstruction and collage, not self-organization and invention.** 

Come to Ideapplebees to find others who are in the same boat, nice and are up for open-minded critical discussions, ultimately agreeing on deconstructing the 1% who are driving all the different problems in different regions!
