**Without the courage** to take the risk and damage of articulating a countervailing view, there is no point in being an artist. Design is a better paid and more recognized job.

**Without the wisdom** to acknowledge one's current inaccuracies, missteps and incapacities, there is no point in studying. Entertainment provides a better, immediate dopamine rush and false sense of security.

**Without the skill** to accurately articulate the problem and gamble on inventing or applying the least stupid solution, if you have the luxury of time, there is no point in acting. Odds are that you will do more harm than good. 

Only if you don't have the luxury of time, a gamble on a stupid, blind, destructive action may be justified.
