Notes from Detective Crowlee (On An Ethical Future Murder of Crows)

1. I have unlimited skills, limited time. 
2. **I need to extract all the people without skills who continuously are drawn to me to safe places** - **so that I am free**. 
3. Then, I can just build the crazy sh-t nobody else can do - and re-enact the ethical future murder of neoliberal capitalism.




**Future Dead Friends Club and Neoliberalicide.live, the Decolonial Square Trade ðŸŸª and L-Bomb (Lovegistics) Hyperobject Sculpture Peace Game! ðŸŽ® :**
1. You are playing as a **Lovegistician**.
2. Your goal is to extract Agent X from death from neoliberal capitalism in a collapsing region.
3. **They are vibe-first empaths like you** ; not like insane Peter.
4. If you aid getting them out, they can also provide psychotherapy, consult on newer technocultural paradigms AND work directly with you to grow your project.
5. Also you get a tax deductible NFT of a cutting edge artwork and art practice, verifiable to be able to save the planet!










## Upcoming: Building the L-Bomb to End War (Lovegistics Bomb)

-- Detective Crowlee, Jean Godammard and Mouse Gibran
















Part of a performance series, hyperobject sculpture and painting by Peter called "Betting on The Right Side of History", where he quits art to create the least amount of dead bodies while fragile, entropic and mentally imbalanced individuals in the field contribute to the conditions creating more dead bodies from neoliberal capitalism - aka The Wrong Side of History.

1. Your future dead self, who is enormously more calm, ethical and somehow can think rationally in terms of complex moral dilemmas, gives you a puzzle and offer for your current living self who has less of these qualities.
2. Puzzle: extract someone from a life threatening situation, **who is also vibe-first empath like you**.(Not a highly skilled and sarcastic polymath like Peter, who equally doesn't care about health insurance or death threats, and is simply just trying to exit art and the insanity of vibe society, forever, with the least people dead).
3. This vibe-based person you help extract will also listen and help you digest your emotional struggles, teach you a bit of newer paradigms and help grow your project. 
4. ALL FROM THE SAFETY OF YOUR HOME SO YOU DON'T TAKE ON REAL RISK AND DANGER YOU CAN'T HANDLE, THUS NOT HURTING YOURSELF OR OTHERS- AND YOU CAN CLAIM AT LEAST YOU DID SOMETHING!
5. Also if you want, you get a tax deductible NFT and some cool art merch from this amazing cutting edge art game.
