The Future Dead Friends Club is a distributed physical pop-up club, digital Club and also adjacent possible Club. It is located in the Decolonies of Amasia, New S.A., Postworkverse.

Rules:
1. To get past the dead ontological doorman, **Bernard Stiegler, aka Steegzie**, you must say this: "All lives end, all ends meet in the Neganthropocene Summit". 
2. This acknowledges that everything alive now is at risk of dying the next second from a random stroke; also it acknowledges all injustices are accurately calculable - given the right alchemical methods of calculation and magic which don't exist yet, to most, in 2023. These are currently being researched and summoned in the Neganthropocene Summit.
3. Inside the Club, the reception desk is staffed by your Ethical Future Dead self, who is so egoless, cool and chill that they dont mind working at the reception desk. They are extremely cheerful, funny and are totally open to indulge in conversations of random tangents.
4. You pay them the entrance fee. It's 10 Critical Coins. These are transmedia Cryptocoins attributed to you based on the personal risk you've undertaken, the lives, organizations and systems you've positively affected and the scars you've accumulated from being a critical voice in neoliberal capitalist modern societies.
5. You walk in. The dimly lit club is filled with past, future and possible dead versions every single entity imaginable. Every piece of the architecture and furniture is constantly morphing in relation to every entity's desires, imaginations and conversations. People are talking, laughing, crying, singing, dancing, drinking, conspiring and so on.
6. There are 3 alien angels superpositionally at the bar, serving the customers and also acting as security. It is Dr. Phil I. Stine, Dr. Quantumstein and Non-binary Blade.
7. There's an open mic with a Non-binary K-pop Cosmophysical Karaoke machine and various musical exorcist rituals and chllenges against various demons, a Postworkverse arcade room with the latest version of Escape From Entropy and Cool School movie library, and a virtual rage room  called "Bestideas.lol" which also has a pantry full of Critical Cakes.
