Save me a lot of time please!








"**Banana Revolution Modelling Competition Sub-challenge, The Devil Came Down to Amasia:** Peter bets his soul to the devil that he has a model that can bring ecosocial peace on Earth. Does he or doesn't he?! And is this model using or not using alien transductive neganthropomorphosis?!!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023




First things first: assemb





##### Why is it accurate to say that a true "hero" is first and foremost one in a disadvantaged state?
1. A "hero" is an entity that is not defined by capacity, it is defined by INCAPACITY in relation to a context.
2. A hero is CIRCUMSTANTIALLY defined by an entity's defiant actions (even if it is the act of inaction) in the face of overwhelming odds despite the exposure to extreme risk, cost and low reward.
3. Thus, a hero is always first and foremost an ANTI-hero. A hero does what is NOT being done, because there is little to no incentive, there is extreme danger, and there is no pleasure.





### Mouse institute, bedworks.





## First things first: MIT (The üêÅ Mouse Institute of Technology) will unveil their revolutionary new technological platform - The Bedworks. You're invited, as well as your bed. We have a transnational dream

mouse institute, catology, we have a transnational dreamwalk. (Dreaming)

Ideapple, fdf club, devil came down to amasia : angels, aliens and AI. (Talking)

Imp emb, cool school, banana rev (doing)






3 insane things observed:

1. All of the world's problems can be solved by better and more accurate logistics; the best art does this.
2. People who need the most help are the worst at logistics - and for the most part, absolutely allergic to learning it, even if they will die without it.
3. People who are great at logistics have zero incentive to help others so they go nuts and kill themselves.





**How does 4th Generation Art (2010 Art) work?**

Basically you have deskilled people appropriating things that skilled people invent. Hence, the limit of 4th Gen Art is basically the limit of what skilled people are willing to give to deskilled people.

5th Gen Art is basically just skilled people actually inventing functional stuff - because 4th Gen has exhausted all the crap that can be appropriated (which is now). That's the difference. 










 The amount of labor necessary for managing the deskilled is so enormous that it creates an infinite service economy. 
 
 This is good, because it then provides employment, socialization and a framework system for the deskilled; the deskilled can work with the deskilled.

 Much better to have them alive and doing random stuff than off the handle and destroying stuff.



### Time to kick off Postworkstock! Join from bed!



Models as car culture


##### Upcoming, the Impossible Embassy, Postworkstock event and Devil Came Down to Amasia album of the Democraseum where you:
1. Connect with others
2. Vent things
3. You figure out how to help yourselves, OR if you need to talk with someone, you talk with Ozan and others.

Peter is off to bet the devil his soul, in a musical album, that he has a model that can bring world peace and apply for sainthood in multiple metaphysical traditions, on the basis of lives saved and inventions made, both physical and intellectual.






##### Amasian.co - a small family business with big goals; a planetary regulation tech, patent and infrastructure co-op undoing all the damage of Amazon.com and all the other massive corporations, particularly in terms of gentrification and incentivization of ecological destruction.





##### The big BACKGROUND, IGNORABLE musical act of Postworkstock: the Devil Came Down to Amasia. 

A sound art album, that 71% of people should ignore and 17% should put on in the background, by Peter where he bets the devil his soul that he has a model that can bring ecosocial peace.

He will also argue for his sainthood in various other metaphysical traditions based on deeds, both physical and intellectual. Everyone is invited to bet for or against his model, or argue for or against his sainthood, including angels üòá , aliens üëæ and AI ü§ñ. **And/or simply put it on mute and just talk to each other!**








## Pop culture logic is horrendously idiotic; the mashup culture is fun! Everything else, pure trash quality thought.







Sessions organization:

Layer 1: open hangout for anyone to self-teach or vibe.

Layer 2: paracademics to randomly spit out whatever they are thinking.

Layer 3: hackathon.

















If we have 2 camps in art:

1. The totally entropic camp.
2. The camp who attempts to be negentropic but are too deskilled.

Why even try here? Total waste of energy. 

Better to accelerate the entropic into self-destruction and show how childlike the deskilled are.
















## Cancer is easier to cure than stupidity, trust




















God, just deliver me to the few people on Earth who are skilled, sane and ethical, Amen.











Time for you all to talk to each other, not Peter, who needs to talk to polymaths.











##### Why is the best collective bargaining move to always ask for Minimum Viable Justice (MVJ) first, with the irrevocable option to renegotiate upon more accurate information later?

1. Modern organizations are as separate as dolphins in the ocean from frozen ice on the moon. Absolutely different alien worlds. 
2. Minimum Viable Justice presupposes that THERE IS a point of justice, and there is a minimum threshold. Any ask between parties is way more likely to be fulfilled if it's a minimum quantity, especially if it's the first ask.
3. Why do you want the irrevocable option later to renegotiate? Because 80% of the time, you don't have full information in the beginning. More time creates more information. 
4. The threshold of minimum viable justice will transform as more evidence enters the picture.
5. Finally, from minimum viable justice, you can then start to walk up to maximum viable justice, as pieces fall into place; everything from funding and exchanges to thresholds and implementation protocols.






##### The number 1 diagnostic hospital in the world corrects 71% of the cases sent to it from lesser hospitals. This means lesser hospitals are 71% inaccurate. 

##### Imagine how much worse art is, where people are not paid to be accurate and there is a culture promoting inaccuracy. I'd estimate a 90%+ case rate of inaccuracy amongst lesser organizations.










God deliver me to the top 11% of the field who are skilled, sane and systematic enough to care nothing about it and can effectively intellectualize, invent and distribute on their own.

I will help all the other 17% specialists and 71% postworking class of regions with whatever, as long as long term, I get the Hell to a group of peers.

# UPCOMING: Ideapplebees / Postworkstock self-directed time session on Tuesday. Specifics to be announced.








##### "I have art that isn't the usual anti-intellectual technophobic stuff for the 71% and poetics for the 17%, it's for the 11% top skilled of the field who have a sense of humor, and I will travel, but for the love of f--king God, its 2023, can't we just do a f--king video call or make a f--king Tik Tok?" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023












The Devil Came Down to Amasia, a conceptual sound art album where the intelligence of the concept üí° is more valuable than the literal sound, unlike the usual reverse:
1. Peter bets the devil his soul that he can construct a model that can produce multi-scalar ecosocial peace.
2. Peter applies for sainthood on the basis of arguments and proof articulating his physical, social and intellectual deeds.
3. Peter bets that he's got a portfolio of the objectively least stupid artworks of the last 7 years, which invert all the conventions of modern stupidity.






### "Impact-based Equality and Justice" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

Equality of distributions and justice of outcomes is in relation to explicitly defined impacts and causal mechanisms constructing impacts; not a random ineffable universal transcendental that will get more killed than not.

Define impacts, save lives; don't, lots of people die for stupid reasons.

For God's sake look at our health care, education and housing systems. Total trash.

##### "Is Peter's Claim to Be the Least Stupid Artist Actually the Most Stupid Artwork, Thus Fullfilling the Dialectic Conditions of A Good Conceptual Artwork While Also Being Self-Aware of It (not to mention being an impeccably elegant artwork) ? BET FOR AND AGAINST!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023






#### "Taking Bets on Who is Actually the Least Stupid Artist Today, Hopefully I Can Put in a Good Run for the Money, if Not, I'd Love to Talk With Whoever Is the Least Stupid Artist or Others Striving to Be So!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

Seriously, I'm just trying to have coffee with experienced artists or people of whatever field! I don't mind educating, it's just a totally different thing than conversing as peers!









Man, the best piece of art I saw in the last 3 years was a conversation with a doctor at Cleveland Clinic.

The dude just handled affect, percept and complex concept effortlessly. Drilled into technicalities while also delicately navigating transcultural differences and life threatening inaccuracies.

Wherever there's people this articulate, accurate and culturally open-ended, I'm going there, ASAP.







##### "Upcoming art-based project demonstrating Taintlytics regional-scale impacts. Based on accurate analysis of tainted public data, who do you bet multiple cyber-positive aliens and angels will claim to be:

1. The 100 least wise and highest visibility artists and 100 most wise and least visibility artists.
2. The 100 worst decisions made by your region's organizations inflating markets, costs of living and creating regional ecosocial insecurity, and the 100 most liable decision makers.
3. The 100 most entropic principles and skills from across cultures and 100 most negentropic principles and skills from across cultures.

Whoever contributes the most to accurately answering these will win $10,000 worth of art. Participants will receive free grants of both tax deductible crypto and crypto projected to rise in speculative value. " Taintlytics, 2023
