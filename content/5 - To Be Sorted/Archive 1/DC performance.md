The only way an actual avant garde art planetary-scale movement can break into public consciousness is simply through hacking, taking things and breaking things, which is laughably easy today.

Of course, to keep people from totally going nuts, there should be a healing cultural front, but detached from all the actually operational stuff. 

Robin Hood style!
