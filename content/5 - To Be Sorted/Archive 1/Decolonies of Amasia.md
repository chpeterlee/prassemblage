**"Contemporary artists are deconstructionists, not self-organizers and inventors; we can automate actual solutions and send contemporary artists back to use their only skill - deconstruction of whatever is within reach. " Chongha Peter Lee, 2023**

Contemporary artists don't think, they are hangry cats you point at things you want to be deconstructed; you also group them together so they send mutual aid to each other when they are injured, thus freeing you up.










#### 🎨 Traditional art is an anti-intellectual competitive freelancer market - like a less exploitative fashion industry. 💃 

#### 📹 Media art is not; it's self-organizing groups of skilled, collaborative and pro-intellectual individuals glued together by critical, self-reflexive and increasingly complexifying logic. 🧠 

Hence the cultures are totally different! Taking bets on which is going to save the planet and all these people with poor mental health!

**The fragile way to make Ideapples:**
1. ☹️ Anti-intellectual and close minded
2. ⚔️ Freelance competition
3. 💰 Capital driven

**The antifragile way to make Ideapples:**
1. 🧠 Pro-intellectual and open-ended
2. 👥  Self-organizing, collaborative groups
3. ✨️ Respectful, self-reflexive, and complex logics



What I love about America, and most of modern societies today, is that they will scoff at logical arguments and statistics but endlessly discuss aliens, angels and psychic powers.










The planet's artworks seem to be devolving the planet, rather than evolving it. Eat better Ideapples.
