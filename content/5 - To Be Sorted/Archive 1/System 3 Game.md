#### Escape From Entropy Peace Game Setting: The Decolonies of Amasia, New S.A., Postworkverse Architecture

**Banana Revolution Modelling:**
1. Propose an objectively wise enough conflict resolution fashion model to a daily, regional or planetary problem.
	- Conflict resolution is made of at least 2 different countervailing perspectings
	- Feel free to bet a level of risk on it.
	- Engage in a fight club and/or Bestideas.lol rage room!
2. The wisest aliens and angels will judge, which we can try to reperform through logical and evidence backed arguments. The smartest devils, evil AI and 1% Illuminati will try to sow confusion, division and misplaced violence.
	- The wisest aliens and angels are singing the keys to the universe through the undefined complexity of everyone's cells.
	- Can Peter decode this alien and angel language?
	- IS THE EARTH actually a giant spaceship powered by the angelic and alien songs in our cells that we can activate through Banana Revolution song, dance and fight clubs? 
3. Genius mischievious teenagers and anyone will make annoying verifiable bets and proofs on what is the right side of history.
   - Axolotls as indicator species
   - Countervailing Perspectives is what defines healthy and less entropic society
   - More complex societies require more widely distributed complexity navigators. 

**Semiotechnics of the Kitchen:**
1. Different generations of theory are like different recipes.
2. Some people are allergic to some ingredients. Always give options for substituting, ignoring or remixing ingredients.
3. New is not always better; depends on context. Simpler is not always wise enough. 
4. We will judge by speculating what the wisest aliens and angels will think.
5. Genius mischievious teenagers and anyone, will make annoying verifiable bets and also proofs on what is on the right side of history.


**Regioncelerationism informational houses:**

1. Regioncelerationism is co-evolutionary surrealism, wisest metaphysics and negentropic autonomism. The 3 binding concepts:
	- Objectively Wise Enough Conflict Resolution Modelling
	- Cosmophysical Sense of Humor is the Most Feminist
	- The Fallacy of Inaccurate Concreteness, The Racist Fallacy of Different is Separate, The Elitist Fallacy of thinking Children's Culture is lesser.
1. Every system can be represented as an informational house or conceptual lens with an informational blueprint and conceptual resolution.
2. Aliens and angels outside are wandering around the universe wisely balancing informational houses as a pre-emptive peace strategy called "Defensive Prealism", because they religiously believe that poorly built info houses with poorly mixed concreteness collapse and make people use inaccurate violence.
3. They usually do it via art, peace games and various affective cultural techniques. 
4. Genius mischievious teenagers and anyone will make annoying bets and verifiable proofs on what is on the right side of history.

### The 3 Tribes:

System 1: Affect First (70%)
System 2: Perception First (29.3%)
System 3: Concept First (.7%)

## "New is not Always Better; Simpler is Not Always Wiser" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023
### "Masterful Models Make Masterless Maps!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023



























Peter has quit contemporary art permanently. Now he makes:

1. The Escape From Entropy Planetary Media Escape Room Game, where he bets on the objectively wisest Banana Revolution models against the smartest devils and 1%, judged by aliens and gods for the best conflict resolution strategies at daily, regional and planetary scale.
2. Kitchen lectures on objective wisdom and complexity while wearing goth DJ garb and playing dope music and dancing / fighting.
3. Feature length music video documentaries with Estamasia for his planetary presidential campaign focusing on regioncelerationism.















**The 2 Tools of the Semiotechnic Kitchen:**
1. The Spatula Test of Objective Wisdom (and the Courage of Countervailism)
2. Baking the Cake of Complexity (and the Masterlessness of Modelism)













****





Banana Revolution Modelling Competition:

1. Anyone can fashion, wear and present a model about what the wisest aliens and/or gods would say are the best conflict resolution 
2.

### Upcoming: Media art jamming!


**What Peter will pursue solo:**
Polymath, planetary-scale intellectualism and invention. (Clearly, it would take 15 years for Peter to transfer the skills to traumatized individuals, who would rather die than learn code, math, logic or anything requiring skill).

**What can be done:**
Regional scale arbitration making education, small business development and health way less traumatizing.







##### Regioncelerationist Escape From Entropy Game Mechanic: Cells=Powers=Vibes

1. You have cells inside you that can power you up from just thinking about what's in arm's reach, to thinking, imagining and arbitrating well about your region or your planet.
2. The more stressed you are, the more damaged your cells get, damaging your health. Also, it will lower the power and accuracy of your thought, imagination and conversation. Catch-22 - if you stress yourself for being stressed you lower your health. **Also you gain health back by having fun.**
3. The more peaceful and calm your vibe is, the more powerful, clear amd accurate your imagination and conversation is, and the more likely you will actually benefit yourself, your region and your planet.
4. To train your Cells=Powers=Vibes Link, you can sing, dance or make and wear a weird and awesome costume!
5. Bet on particular pieces of imagination, opinion to see if they will stand up to more and more different perspectives!



















# What the Hell is 2023 Actually?

1. Art and Philosophy is in the 19th Century
2. Sciences and Government is in the mid-20th Century 
3. Culture and Commerce is in 1990













~~~~


# 3 Obvious Things:

1. There is no culture of arbitrating information neutrally and accurately across cultures.
2. There is no culture of accurate synthesis.
3. There is no culture of autodidacticism.


















##### Last touch - communicating [[]]enough planetary-scale complexity (System 3) to System 2 and System 1 to keep them from making disastrously unwise judgements:

1. Because it's so complex, everything at the planetary-scale is a **wise or unwise opinion or a bet in a PEACE GAME.**
2. There is NEVER 100% certainty, unless you are an angel, an alien or a superhero and shaman, or a genius teen polymath or God forbid, an adult polymath.
3. There is more or less accuracy per statement, claim and piece of evidence, which we can imagine visually as a conceptual house. Per problem and case, anyone can self-teach themselves to have the wisest opinion - or the most sturdy, fun and beautiful informational house! (Also, there are some aliens who are solely interested in making all informational houses of the universe, sturdy, fun and beautiful because they believe it keeps other aliens, including humans from going nuts and run around destroying their nice houses!)




















# Wisdom/opinion

Lens 1x / 10x / 100x Accuracy

More parts and longer time = more complex

Adequate enough per time frame and scale?

"Devil Came Down to Amasia - Peace Game artwork - a System 3 game of planetary polymath skill that even a 13 year old child could self-teach to win, thus negating all the fears of hierarchical intelligence by traumatized specialists:

1. Peter is going to bet with the devil, mischievious polymath teenagers,  and alien ðŸ‘½ angels the size of the planetâ€” that he can accurately frame planetary-scale (System 3) problems and solutions and propose particular solutions to particular problems.
2. And totally just for arbitrary kicks, he will confirm the bets with the world's verified 3 leading transdisciplinary intellectuals. 
3. **He will also make a literal song and dance out of them to entertain 70% of the populace because they honestly probably don't give a sh-t.**" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023
