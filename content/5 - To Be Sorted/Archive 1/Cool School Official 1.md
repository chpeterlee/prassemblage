### Research Notes by Detective Crowlee: What is "good vibes" and why is this the only goal that 70% of the population can imagine? (Aka, Postwork or die). 

1. The human brain is biased towards System 1 - locomotive, unconscious and parasympathetic functions simply to keep the organs working and the body alive. There are numerous unconscious nervous system and chemical responses which produce what people call are "good vibes".  For most people, whatever triggers "good vibes" is the extent of reality.
2. It takes education to help a human body develop System 2 skills - abstracted logics beyond the line of sight. There is also an emerging theory of a "System 3" dealing with accurate statistical imagination, intellectualism and invention.
3. During CO-VID, human populations across ages were basically stunted in development - every demographic missed key processes that expanded their psychosocial and technical vocabulary. This is evident in students today.
4.  During the 1980's, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher issued budget cuts to social services and education, along with coercive military and financial policies that basically stunted the growth of entire regions. This is why educational and institutional staff is underpaid, underresourced and underskilled, and why we repeatedly see individuals with psychotic behaviors due to cognitive impairments in industries.
5. The future is easily projectable; either re-organize institutions and industries to provide missing services for traumatized populations and thrive in postwork economies - or fail to do so and collapse into conflict, stagnation and entropy.

## "The Number 1 Fifth Generation Art Puzzle: What Do Good Luck Vibes ACTUALLY Smell Like 👃 ?" Elan Semiotechne, 2023








# ESCAPE FROM ENTROPY POV Game 🎮 :

1. You wake up in 2023. Everything is a f--king APP WHAT THE F--K. WHERE ARE THE VIBES?
2. You realize you have been educated in the Humanities. Most Humanities programs are primarily semiotics and are allergic to today's technological tools. 
3. The Humanities are 40 years away from catching up to 2023. Only London, France and Italy have tech-friendly Humanities.
4. Your skills, because they primarily are linguistic, are centered around text, photo and video.
5. **Go into education, media and service work!**

# Why Media Art Today for Most People?

1. It's free.
2. It's fun.
3. You can be as stupid, weird or philosophical as you want, and you have an 80% higher chance of actually learning something.
4. Media art skills and perceptions can be turned into flexible jobs; if you're a painter, good luck!
5. Because you are more cognitively flexible and adaptive from media art, you have higher emotional intelligence, social intelligence and systems intelligence.








# All philosophies are not equally wise. Some philosophies are objectively less stupid than others. 

#### Proof? There are some philosophies that endorse drinking poison to kill yourself immediately. If 7 billion of us used this philosophy, we would all be dead. Duh. 

Anyone who wants to endorse, reinvent or refuse to critically define the MOST STUPID philosophies, please do so far the f--k away from me, thanks dude, good luck with the poison, hope that works out for ya👍!

### "Interpassive (or Ambient) Collaborative Art, Research, Peace, Health and Modelling Games", Chongha Peter Lee, 2023












Slackers, stoners and senseless- time for Postworkstock!















### The Impact Economy: the economy of the less than 5% of every field which is comprised of individuals who actually create impacts.








#### "Under the Skin in the Game: The Interpassive Proxy Action Movie That Could Actually Save the Planet (And Ambient Multi-Modal-Model and Alternate Reality Health Game) " Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

Lots of slackers, stoners and sensitive people everywhere? Make an interpassive action movie!


















##### "Just like every other field, 90% of the media art field is watchers, commentators and tinkerers — not producers and paradigm shifters. There's only 10% who do that — just like every other field. Hence why interpassive collaboration is necessary to articulate as a culture." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023





Top 10%




#### What skills put someone in the top 29.3% in art?
1. **Physical and digital skills**; it is common for traumatized, obsessive or fixated individuals to emotionally attach to a single mode of making or thinking.
2. **Inclusive and scalable administration**: it is absolutely commonplace for uninclusive and unscalable artists to destroy an organization.
3. **Accurate and imaginative interpreter**; it is commonplace to have an artist Google and inaccurately connect random quotes from different authors with zero capacity to produce verifiable syntheses.
*If you are an admin, it will cost dearly to hire from the 70% without these skills.












**Why is hiring from the deskillled, chemically imbalanced and negative impact 70% population of your field the worst possible thing for you AND them?**

1. The deskilled 70% do not need work - they need space, tools and time. They are the patients to be served.
2. This is provided by institutions staffed by competent personnel. **Imagine if you staffed a hospital with the deskilled and traumatized patients as the doctors.**
3. If the deskilled and traumatized are the doctors, they will also eventually collapse from stress and self-awareness of their incapacities, potentially leading to suicide. So long run- it is also bad for them.

#### "11%: The Impact Class Interpassive Film " Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

A film of a class of individuals independent of any form of capital, simply circumstantially defined by their capacity to sustainably, inclusively and scalably impact various systems in various domains.

People pass in and out of the impact class.









Short-term solution: pool all the functional together to rally the dysfunctional.


Long-term solution: make a small list of actually skilled intellectuals and inventors, eventually work only with them.











#### 












Someone told me that I should go work with my people; **people who can do statistics, think rationally and have skills.**

Yes, I think I should definitely do that. The Hell am I going to do in art lol if nobody is doing this? I'm looking for peers, not students. 

However, in order to exit gracefully and justify the inordinate amount of time spent in a 70%+ zero impact field, I must wrap up loose ends, then it is goodbye forever.










Adults are so insane that they'd rather die than learn how to reason accurately when needed.

Long-term solution to life: only work with skilled intellectuals and inventors, have everyone else kept in check by the least stupid teenagers. 

Don't waste time trying to teach anyone who can't teach themselves.











The magic escape rocket 🚀:

1. Pool all the insane people together.
2. Automate all the important stuff.
3. Peter talks with journalists with PhD's.













God if there was some type of app to alert me of people who aren't intelligent enough to have a good sense of humor, I'd pay out the nose for it.

Also, I'd pay for membership of a new platform if it kicked everyone who was inane or serious the Hell off of it.









Why not an app that simply just automatically curated the best content in the world and filtered out all the stupid sh-t?

I dont mind if you kill me, bankrupt me or imprison me, but for the love of God don't force me to suffer through so many mediocre thoughts and such a lack of imagination.

I prefer not to.










The first most important division of the internet to make is between "accurate" and "deskilled" to save lives.

The second distinction to make is between "interesting" and "boring" to save lives.

It would be a hilarious skit to argue for divisions of the internet on grounds of cognitive differentiation.

It is also a hilarious result of the paradox of individual rights and the ideal of social equality that one individual cannot force another more accurate individual to give them more accurate information.








Why don't we just compare avant garde art in terms of sustainability, inclusivity and scalability? 










What you've all been waiting for!

### Why be another fucking tight assed uncool boring killjoy dysfunctional danger about what is just fucking statistics and philosophy? Get your fucking ass checked by Taintlytics, and get the right philostatisticalaxative prescribed for you and your organization!



















Why waste time, energy and money on things that clearly don't work?

What is this ridiculousness that's it's so difficult for so many to conceive of an accurate comparative discourse in the 21st Century?













Literally, I have had to teach people what accuracy means and how it keeps people from dying lol.



















M
People + no skills = mediocrity.

##### Would it not be a solid artwork if the objectively most skilled artist on the planet refused to enter art because the field was so clearly too deskilled to change anything?








## Plan for non-profit workers:

1. Connect.
2. Vent.
3. Contract the right skilled outsiders via Antifragile Agency to regulate.
