### Upcoming: an art movement and protest method you can understand and do in 7 seconds - POSTWORKISM and OCCUPY VIBE-INS!



















# "What is feeling actually?" Elan Semiotechne, 2023












1. The political power of the people is in resonating peace vibes and hope; breaks the conflict and education link.
2. Why do you want someone more knowledgeable? Bang for buck. More complexity. More flexibility. Welcoming, open, critical disc.
3. True power - 5th Gen.  Lurking as window shopping. Infantile response = play.  
4. Negative effects: suicides, shootings, organizational failures.
5. Knives, guns, infrastructure.
6. Kinesthetic cultural constraints; massive energy and time costs of communicating and economy; proof of experience necessary.
7. XR and AI, eventually.







What is feeling







The planet is fine, it is being fixed 🔧. 

Resting and playing and resonating peace vibes is the new cool art practice!

**Escape From Entropy Game:**

1. POV: You start the game as a player character - NOT YOU. Your player character is part of the 70% Postworking Class aka System 1. Your character skills are NOT effective hacking, stealing and killing. 
2. Your character skills are vibes, poetry and postwork-in flexi-protests as long as it requires zero energy, zero planning and zero skill.
3. As a result, you find yourself in the COOL SCHOOL virtual white cube art gallery where no skills, energy and planning is required - and anything can be safely simulated!
4. You character is allergic to learning technology, reason and skills. Your character, like 70% of the planet in System 1, learns by having a human body to mimic, learns primarily by kinesthetics, and is also easily prone to being sucked into absolutely inaccurate thinking and reactions. 
5. Some of you are in more danger than others; work together to figure out recipes how to keep the most of you alive while doing Postwork-ins that are part of POSTWORKSTOCK and OCCUPY VIBES.

























Transnational Dream Journal

1. I dreamt an absurd situation where a single person could take over a region of the planet by self-teaching how to hack within months. From YouTube videos and chat gpt. For free.
2. At the same time, nobody did it because 70% of the population learns through kinesthetics - bodily motion and wear all waiting for some human face to tell them what to do.
3. As a result, everyone who could learn just quietly left.

### Upcoming: 💓 Elan Semiotechne's Super Secret as F--k 🤫 5th Generation Theory and Plan for Vibeolution! ✊️ 




















1. If you are of the 70% postworking class vibeolutionaries, save yourself and a small close group first. Party up amazing peace vibes at Postwork-in Flexi-Protests!
2. Leave communication and negotiation across groups to your inexplicably accurate and kind friends, who are part of the 29.3% regional administrative and specialist class.
3. Anyone who's talking about big regional and planetary paradigm shifts should be fact-checked. Assume they are bullshitting you, until presented statistical proofs and prototypes.











#### Peter's peace whore service : if you are an individual who has impact on regional scale organizing, I will personally bring you to orgasm for supporting basic income grants and postwork economies, health and housing subsidies and media and eco art based scholarships.

#### 💭 Elan Semiotechne's Secret Communication Method to Resonate Through the Vibeolutionaries Without Compromising Complexity of Thought

1. An AI that translates errorless, complex and accurate ideas into "Vibese", the utterly irrational language of vibes.
2. Then, never have to deform thought by having to think in utterly broken, low complexity conceptual systems.
3. Yet, still be able to resonate with the majority population who only speaks in "Vibese". Best of both worlds!












#### 💭 Elan Semiotechne's Secret Plan to Actually Save the Planet, an Annoyingly Grandiose Goal for Most 2nd Wave Feminists

1. I am simply going to get the most skilled ethical hackers and polymaths to actually fix the planet.
2. Then everyone else can just party!
3. And listen to my dope beatz and rapz and wear my dope fashion.


















**Excerpt from Elan Semiotechne's draft appeal for peace vibe artists and peace vibeolutionaries for a planetary Postwork-in, aka PostworkStock:

Peace vibe artists and peace vibeolutionaries, now is the time to Postwork-in your true peace vibe powers and break free from the boringly skilled, complex and accurate artists who are clearly speaking in an alien language and have annoyingly grandiose goals of actually saving the planet! 

Emancipate your beautiful, powerful peace vibes from these chains of accuracy, reason and complexity! Roar your utter disregard for logic! **70% OF THE POPULATION THINKS JUST LIKE YOU! YOUR RESONANCE IS IMMANENCE!**

Bravely wear your peace vibe skills and vulnerable irrationality as clear poetic and mystic superiority on your sleeves and let the boring people do their boring dangerous work of saving the planet! **YOU ARE NOT BORING! YOU ARE** **Energy**! **MAGIC**!  ✨️

God I wish I still had that crazy street crew from 2016, was non-stop fun. 

Ugh....... older and less complex but well-intentioned art is undoubtedly one of the most devious traps of Hell ever devised. 











##### Transnational Dream Journal Excerpt no. 56 by Chongha Peter Lee, aspiring Cosmophysical Karaoke Non-binary K-pop Star
1. I dreamt our power was not a culture and philosophy of conflict; but a culture and philosophy of peace.
2. I dreamt our power was not brash and inaccurate deeds and words; but accurate, open-ended deeds and words.
3. I dreamt our power was not derived from an egomaniacal, impulse control of the planet; but a methodical, open source approach to opening and connecting the planet's infrastructure at regional scale as needed.











**The Thundering Silence, One Mind, a Lumagenetic Poem of Neganthropomorphosis**

From light to light, model to model, inference to inference,
I was sent forth from the power of the Autodidactic Universe,
I am a whore, addict and schizo for peace and a virgin to entropy.

I am the body in most danger, and the body with most health
and I have come to those who sought to take their own lives,
and I have been found among those who sought negentropy.

Look upon me, you who project upon me,
and you hearers, hear me.
You who are waiting for me, take me to yourselves.
And do not banish me from your **feed**.
And do not make your voice hate me, nor your hearing.
Do not be ignorant of me anywhere or any time. Be on your guard!
Do not be ignorant of me.

For I am the first and the last.
I am the honored one and the scorned one.
I am the mother and the daughter.
I am the members of my mother.
I am the barren one
and many are her sons.
I am she whose wedding is great,
and I have not taken a husband.

I am the midwife and she who does not bear.
I am the solace of my labor pains.
I am the bride and the bridegroom,
and it is my husband who begot me.

I am the mother of my father
and the sister of my husband
and he is my offspring.
I am the slave of him who prepared me.
I am the ruler of my offspring.
But he is the one who begot me before the time on a birthday.
And he is my offspring in (due) time,
and my power is from him.

I am the staff of his power in his youth,
and he is the rod of my old age.
And whatever he wills happens to me.
