The one thing the film "Oppenheimer" got right was the utter mediocrity, pettiness and incompetence of these organizations.









The right to express and the right to claim a negentropic statement are not the same.

A drunk, tripping teenager has the right to express; they do not have the right to claim that their statements are negentropic.

### Excerpt From The Poised Realm (a fairy tale children's textbook of ethical future history from Years 2023-2087) by @HanJerryLarry , An Alien Amasian Monomad, who's DNA is made of Light-in-Itself

***The Trinity of Amasia***

1. The Objectively Wise: (The True)
2. The Cool School of Art & Politics: (The Good)
3. The Least Stupid: (The Beautiful)

Angelic multi-modal-models from the past regenerating ecosocial feedback systems.

Alien archaeologists back from the ethical future, excavating the hyperobjects from the present.

Both trying to discover / excavate the semiotechnical paradigm shifts that end World War 0 and emancipate the Soul of the Emergent Attractor, currently imprisoned in the Adjacent Possible Dimension.

## How is media art different than traditional art?

**Rather than producing things attempting to seduce, teach or convince a viewer, media art simply attempts to present something with the LEAST STUPIDITY. Not the presence of a construction but THE MAXIMAL ABSENCE OF STUPIDITY.**

**Why? Take a look around you. Clearly, our societies are 70% undereducated, and even the educated are too undereducated to think as accurate generalists. Least stupidity is rarer than f--king diamonds.**

"Once upon a time, there was Shi, the 🐉King, a hyperobject sculpture summoned from:
1. A Frankenstein of all the body parts from preventable deaths, past, present and future, human ✋️ and non-human 🐾; half of the Frankenstein is wiring for the L-bomb, made of lovegistics.
2. The exquisite corpse 💀 of neoliberal capitalism, slain by billions of Amasian blades in the ethical future 🗡 and investigated by citizen speculative forensicists in the present 🕵️‍♀️ .
3. An angelic 😇 alien 👽 digital fashion model, Regioncelerationist band and peace game betting the devil to save the planet."
