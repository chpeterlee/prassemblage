Last night, I dreamt I was talking to @HanJerryLarry, the alien ðŸ‘¾ archaeologist back from the ethical future of 2087, hyperobject of Land-in-itself, and postworking class cultural critic and curator. He is also a Speaker of the Neganthropomorphic Attractor.

After a massively long-winded introduction that 70% of my postworking class **System 1** ðŸ§  neural architecture totally did not grok, my 29.3% specialist educated **System 2** ðŸ§  neural architecture kicked in and registered that these were all fictionalized references to Manuel de Landa, Francois Laruelle and Bernard Stiegler. 

My 0.7% **System 3** ðŸ§  neural architecture bet my **System 1** ðŸ§  and **System 2** ðŸ§  neural architectures that "this sh-t was on the right non-binary side of history, yo."
