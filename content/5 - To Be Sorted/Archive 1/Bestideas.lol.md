Upcoming - open call for technologically and culturally skilled artists from conflict zones for complex, dangerous conflict resolution art project.
















Escape rocket 🚀 to Phase 3: polymath invention and philosophy for journalists with PhD's.

Almost there.

















# The Cool is Political.














**Why is the cool political? A polemic decrypted from the Least Stupid alien 👾 and angel 😇 postworking class UberEats driver turned art critic, *@HanJerryLarry*.**

Being cool 😎  is being able to deal with way more uncertainty, complexity and diversity.

If all the fucking idiots shooting each other, exploiting each other and running the world's organizations into dead ends were fucking cooler 😎 , then we wouldn't have to deal with so much goddamn uncool bullshit.
# FUCK! 
-- Yours Truly, @HanJerryLarry














### Loading - 1 cult belief 🐉, 1 magic ritual ✨️ and 1 peace game 🎮 to protect you and your loved ones:

1. Street Level: The Spirit of Negentropy (sung by angels and aliens through your autodidactic cells) 🐉, and the Devil Came Down to Amasia challenge album, at the Future Dead Friends Club 💀.  And the Xenabloom Garden and Conflict Resolution Diagnoses by Conceptual Lens Crafters 🔭.
2. Regional Scale: Semiotechnics of the Kitchen 🍴 at Ideapplebees. Graceful Gravity Gym. Regioncelerationist Hackathon 🔧 at the Paradigm Shift Racetrack.
3. Planetary Scale: The Playtheon 5th Generation Warfare Peace Game by the Least Stupid 13 year olds, or LS13, fighting for the Decolonies of Amasia 🎮 And MetaHattan Project of Lovegistics L-Bomb.


















##### Upcoming project: Playtheon is recruiting citizen forensics and logistics for the MetaHattan "L-bomb"; a "bomb 💥 "of love ❤️ and open source logistics (like the Underground Railroad) to keep as many people alive, healthy and complexifying today as possible!

If you participate, you get credit on your CV as an Antifragile Agency artist and contractor!









Upcoming open call for project: Playtheon is recruiting contractors for a Peace Game 🎮 cyber militia simulation.

Looking specifically for the rare self-disciplined, self-teaching youth who already have a strong and wise sense of ethics, and have defended or aided others at their own personal risk. 

They can personally handle physically dangerous situations, understand social, economic, legal and philosophical systems and can improvise with any tool.

Referrals appreciated! 🙏



 
 
 
 







**Ethical Futures Institute Jeopardy  101




A Seminar, Peace Game, Film and Children's Textbook of a History of 2023-2087:

**Ethical Futures Jeopardy Question no. 349:**

Whyare the **unpopular and less visible, but objectively wiser conflict resolution models**, for both ecological and social issues, at daily, regional and planetary scales today?

To be bet on by aliens 👽 and judged by angels 😇 !















### What are the limits of 2010-era research, theory art and media culture (aka 4th Gen Art)?

1. Projects without impact.
2. Fragile and entropic cultural paradigms can get them or you killed in complex life and death situations, without people even realizing the risks.
3. Low complexity dialogue, thus less likelihood of conflict resolution.















#### Escape From Entropy Peace Game 🎮 (Using a 5th Generation Art Game Engine):

POV: It's 2023, there's more news about the ZzpalestinezZ and ZzisraelzZ conflict. You're an average person of working, lower, or middle middle class.

1. **You don't have any skill points in Killing, Stealing or Hacking**; only a few individuals of the world have these skills in military, criminal and corporate organizations.
2. An alien 👽 lands in front of you







#### Absolute boredom with everything that exists, the mother of art.














### Why are heroes, either individuals or groups, humans and non-humans, inherently stupid and the more effective ones are self-aware of it?















- Boringly insane anti-intellectuals, no thanks.
- Insanely boring intellectuals, no thanks.

So there's 80% of the population.

Is there some Excluded Middle here? Just trying to make art that doesn't suck and have fun whilst doing so! 

Truly don't need all this other baggage.












## 2023 Landscape and Goals:

##### 1. 40% Objectively insane anti-intellectuals.

##### 2. 40% Insanely boring intellectuals.

##### 3. 20% the Excluded Middle (My People).
Dude, I'm just trying to make art that doesn't suck, with people that are neither insane nor boring.











#### "An unimaginable social network:

1. Intellectuals that can both hack and wage war
2. Inventors with ethics and literacy
3. Activists with self-discipline and imagination" Elan Semiotechne,  2023












##### What the hell is the "Mie Class Research-Based Artist Edge Lord Nerd of the 2010's?",(A note by Elan Semiotechne, an obvious parody of this.)

1. In 2010 art, there was a **40 year late epiphany** by civilian society that militaries and intelligence have ongoing surveillance operations and technologies, which are legal, illegal and grey.
2. And they lie, steal and kill!. 😮.  And civilians hates risk, tech and organizing so there is a low probability of an effective response, and the poor kill the poor while shouting that thinking about why they're killing each other isn't action! 😮 . **Welcome to reality - more unnecessarily boring than you could ever imagine! 😴 
3. Okay anyways - now we have people who can do the actual craft of hacking, stealing and killing, and they work either in hidden organizations or in criminal organizations ; then we have those who can't because they are deskilled, fragile and probably have undiagnosed mental disorders - but can surf the internet, photoshop a couple memes and also maybe make a short video essay. 
4. In 2010, these people turned to research-based media art as an outlet.
5. That's all, nke they just circulate in universities, various conferences, output some things to the media and bullshit to investors every so often. Absolutely nothing is going to come of it - it was fully done 10 years ago! **I personally would be bored as Hell doing this!**

















## Upcoming:

1. Online Ideapplebees idea potluck, Cookbook and Speculative Documentary of the Banana Revolution. *(For objectively wise enough conflict resolution modelling.)*
2. Democraseum 2.0, Regioncelerationism and the Cool School critical cinema club.
3. Philosoton walks through State Space AI and various peaces games of the Emergent Center.















### What is art in 2023?

Well, every single existing problem of inequity and education can simply be automated away over time.

This means art could only be the complexification of thought first, percept and affect second; everything else is a bit staid.

















Art Performance by Chongha Peter Lee:

Peter simply goes and films where the most interesting conversations and conversationalists on the planet are.



















-----

The actual art part: make a beautiful, complex film work, for the highly literate. 

Everything else, both the solutions and education of the public, can be automated.








**World War 0 Subplot**

During World War 0, rogue AI, out of sheer boredom, simply just build a data model to find the most interesting people to have conversations with.












Word of advice for young artists, or anyone to be honest: if you ever run into objectively highly literate individuals, don't lose their number.

Sidenote: if you are an objectively highly literate individual, I'd be interested in a conversation!











##### And lo, so it came to pass, that the 3 systems were parted; and thus, those who could, did, gradually disappearing from view. 

Can't wait to get back to making actual conceptual artwork for a small, literate audience! My favorite. 













Second thought - it might be more horrible if there's a proliferation of accurate and complex systems and then people just turn it into the same banal entropy.... 

Okay, so let's not take chances on the lowest tier, just automate that stuff.











#### Foundations complete! 

**Democraseum 2.0** exhibition proposal in works! Bigger, better, yummier! 🥘












## Upcoming: The Ideapplebees Potluck, Cookbook and Speculative Documentary! 
(of Objectively Wise ENOUGH Conflict Resolution Models)

















#### The Game of Adulting, for Adults, and for Youth to Accurately Measure Adults Against:

Basically, the Game of Adulting is to increase the same, core childish wonder, play and joy with the planet as a youth while simultaneously reducing your footprint of stupid, dehumanizing sh-t.

Basically:
1. Increase wonder, play and joy.
2. Decrease dehumanizing stupidity.
3. The best is transcultural, transgenerational work that does this!











##### Ideapplebees Scenario - the internet as the Infinite Cosmic Buffet 🥘 of dehumanization or humanization in your hand, all the time. See it simply as options, not the "reality" of "everyone"!

1. It's 2023. You have a smartphone connected to the internet.
2. In less than 7 seconds, you can access some trashy, stupid banal content, some commentary on current events, **OR some science, philosophy and art.**
3. **30 years ago, the trashy, stupid and banal content and commentary would be pretty much THE EXACT SAME.**
4. **30 years ago, it would have been almost physically impossible and cost you 10 years and over $100,000** to access the science, philosophy and art available now.
5. Of course, this stuff is harder to digest, and you have jobs and etc. You don't need to drop everything and study, **simply just be aware that you have the OPTION to engage or disengage with content that will dehumanize you and others and there is content that will make you more human** and able to navigate the planet with less trouble. 





















Bet, objectively wise conflict resolution models, AI.


#### Clearly AI is much smarter and more cautious in articulating topics dealing with more than a household...



















Regioncelerationism, 3-Tier Exhibition Approach:

3. Forensic Architecture / New Centre and above complexity.
2. Hito Steyerl / Hirschhorn level complexity.
1. Post-internet / Fluxus level complexity.












70% of culture is in 1990! Amazing. 
Easy to just spot it and play it.





### Escape From Entropy Game:

1. Make a conflict resolution **model** however you'd like!
2. If your reason becomes overwhelmed by feelings, go to the @**bestideas.lol virtual rage room** and rage out! Win cool points for not immediately reacting, then reflecting, and then responding with a more balanced, complex perspective.
3. Play **Interpretive Skeeball** to safely playtest which interpretations do more or less damage to communities, regions and planet!














-----

#### Escape From Entropy Game Mechanic:

Don't react immediately to information; the more you can calm yourself down, reflect and then offer a balanced, complex opinion or interesting bet, you win cool 😎 points.

















### Ideapplebees Ideappetizers 🥗:

1. Imagine that **there are people who have already cooked objectively wise enough conflict resolution models to all of today's conflicts.**
2. Imagine you can either **Google** them or **ask Chat GPT** about them.
3. Imagine that you can do more to affect today's conflicts by **keeping your cool 😎** and performing sincerely and accurately what is common to all humans  — the limits of our knowledge, perceptions and affects  — **and thus the never ending need for goodwill, humor and deeper reflection.**
4. Imagine **entering into this reflection will actually help clarify the complexities** of the conflicts, and if you do so continuously, **you will eventually reach the same common sense conflict resolutions that other people did decades ago.**












## Brainwave
1. All the complex and accurate analyses of today's conflicts were done at least a decade ago.
2. The people who are fighting and dying over this stuff are the less educated because they haven't had time to learn that they were stuck on a hamster wheel of history.
3. The problem then is just aesthetic intervention, not discussion.
















## Escape From Entropy Game Mechanic

1. Gain cool points for keeping your cool 😎 and thinking through complex situations and coming up with wise, open-ended conflict resolutions.
2. Lose cool points for losing your cool and causing harm to yourself or others, unintentionally. You will be redirected to a healer following this!












How to deal with international conflicts:

1. Ignore the streets.
2. Aid victims.
3. Invent better intellectualism and infrastructure - the root cause.

# The Ideapplebees Information Eating Utensils.

1. SELF AS KNIFE: 🔪 Think of one's psychology as a knife - extremely simple, light and mobile, forgetful and playful, and by default, unattached and constantly unattaching. Wisdom is self awareness of how childish humans naturally are, and why it's good.
2. REGIONAL SCALE AS FORK:🍴 Think of regional scale issues as requiring multiple tines, connected by a handle to properly spear an objectively wise enough conflict resolution model.
3. PLANETARY SCALE AS SPOON 🥄 : Think of planetary scale thought as a spoon. It requires broad, general understanding to deal with boiling hot topics in small amounts. Generally, mainstream media is so f--king stupid - go read philosophy. Assemblage Theory.

















"Knowing of something cool is like pulling a trigger; knowing how to make something cool is like knowing enough of the laws of physics to be able to engineer the gun.

Sadly, we will always be short on those of the latter, particularly with the ethics to not misapply force." Jean Goddammard, Working Class Horse Turned Theoretical Filmmaker, 2023

















# Escape From Entropy Game Mechanic

In a bizarre parody of the real world, there are some automated non-player characters who randomly say things.











# Escape From Entropy Game Mechanic

1. Every time you lose your f--king sh-t or endanger yourself or others without justification, you LOSE COOL POINTS 😎. 

2. Every time you do something badass in the face of overwhelming odds and/or complexity you GAIN COOL POINTS 😎. 











"An objectively wise conflict resolution model puzzle game: PETER THE LIVING PUZZLE.

How the F--k can this dude be competent across multiple specialist domains, verified by various experts, without going through 100 years of schooling? Clearly most individuals have trouble being accurate in a single specialist domain with years of supported education!

Make an objectively wise enough conflict resolution model without endorsing any fascist, racist or elitist fallacies."  Chongha Peter Lee, 2023.













### "Open call for anti-intellectuals to do what they do best - not think and break sh-t!" Chongha Peter Lee








  
"Short 10 or 15 minute **Philosoton** walks through both your neighborhood forests and also a super cool digital forest of the **Emergent Centers**, comprised of objectively wise enough conflict resolutions which can also incorporate your objectively wise enough conflict resolutions for strengthening your communities! 

At daily, regional and planetary scale." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023

#### "Objectively WiseST will take decades to get to; let's shoot for Objectively wise ENOUGH for a given context!" Chongha Peter Lee, 2023















##### "Upcoming art and sound walks: PHILOSOTON - the super chill philosophical exercise and workshop of walking pleasurably in the woods, and thinking/dialoguing like 20 minutes a day, training and testing State Space, an AI for objectively wise enough conflict resolution models at daily, regional and planetary scale." Chongha Peter Lee, 2023













**Entry Number 777** of the Escape From Entropy Game: Banana Revolution Modelling Competition.

**ENTRY TITLE:** The Devil Came Down to Amasia

1. TO WHOM: Peter prays to the wisest aliens 👽 of Complexity Science and the wisest angels 😇 of Assemblage Theory.
2. FOR WHAT? To judge his bet against the smartest devilish binaries 😈 and evil AI linearities. 
3. ABOUT WHAT? On his bets on the objectively wisest conflict resolution models for daily, regional and planetary scales which are accurate open-ended attributions of the work of others.























Some individuals will be engaged with via dialogue; some will simply just get a mushroom 🍄.















## Give up the 20th Century; Leverage the 21st.

1. If we had people who could do Forensic Architecture grade analysis, production and ethics, then we could work at planetary scale. We don't, so we can't and we won't.
2. We can work at regional scale which is actually the scale at which wars can be ended and ecological and social conflicts can be solved.
3. Paradoxically, give up the unrepentant inflexible stupidity of the 20th Century, and easily achieve all its objectives.

##### Bestideas.lol is now opening a POSTWORK PUNK virtual rage room next to Ideapplebees! How does it work:
1. When you are dealing with a complex system and are feeling angry, IF you can remember to do so - stop talking to whomever you are talking to and DIRECT MESSAGE @BESTIDEAS.LOL ANYTHING, PARTICULARLY A PHOTO OF YOU BREAKING A **PIECE OF TRASH**!
2. Messages will be deleted; also, for every foul thing said an AI will spit out a best idea!
